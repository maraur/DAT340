0/0	"Being a member of the European Union is a bit like going to a sandwich shop and buying a ¬£3 sandwich with a ¬£5 note and getting back over ¬£1,000 in change"
1/1	"Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united Europe"  No. It is the end of an anti-national, centralized, globalist, neoliberal and authoritarian system and organism like the EU and its hegemonic power over Europe.
1/1	"Europe Union 'lost' Britain." is more accurate. Now the EU has decided they're happy for Britain to leave as long as they can keep our cash, use us as a military base for a 10-nation "coalition of the willing", and hand down rules forever unchallenged by any form of British input in the workings failings of the EU. Britain was a major pillar of the EU and is still a central player in Europe and the world. What bothers me more is in March 2019 Britain is set to leave and the deal worked for Britain does not serve Britain but Brussels. I can't begin to describe the bloodbath we the British public are going to inflict upon our politicians at the next General Election if they sell us short with a BRslavery. Britain will be a minor-coalition of parties and independents for the next 30 years while Britain is rebuilt. Red and Blue who played their part in this deliberate betrayal will be utterly obliterated and forever regarded as traitors.   If May can't cut it get the 42 letters in RIGHT NOW!   We will hold you to account if you don't.  We're watching...

Okay...

1/1	1 UK vote to leave the EU is done. If u have another u still lose and prove your weak. Man up UK
1	1) Old people ruined everything? No they built the country we're living in. 2) I'm 27 & voted out because I can see an ANTI-DEMOCRATIC system. Not being able to vote for our law makers or President of 500 million people says it all really. 3) I live in France and still voted out because I put principle before ease of life. My girlfriend of 5 years is French and she understood my reason for OUT. 4) Europeans aren't all pro-EU, infact they are people just like us. They also signed up for a trade agreement that was highjacked into a political union nobody in Europe asked for. 5) It's an out dated concept created in the times of the Cold War and Soviet Union. 6) EU is a political institution & is completely separate from Europe as a whole. 7) You cannot create security & provide free Healthcare with unlimited immigration. 8) Turkey is going to join the EU if it's still around in several years. The country that has protected, supplied & supported Jihadists in Syria. It also brought us closer to WW3 with no thought towards other NATO members. 9) The UK would have had to adapt to the Euro if we remained in, removing our ability to manage our own currency. No inflation of deflation means no control of your economy. When it goes wrong look at Greece & Spain. 10) TTIP, the EU is in the process of opening our doors to US corporations, ones like Kaiser medical if you know where I'm going with this?  All Leave campaigners aren't misinformed, jobless, racist, xenophobic, bigoted mongos like some of the Remain camp are singing right now. If you are desperate to live in an undemocratic society, move to Iran or North Korea. You can have your Dear Leader there.

1/1	A Remain vote represents Britain's apocalypse - the country will be irrevocably changed by mass immigration and by conspiracies based in Brussels to create an EU superstate, of which Britain will be merely a disempowered province. We want our law making back, our courts to be the final arbiter of life in Britain and robust border controls reinstated to allow us to manage our resources for the benefit of our own people. Only the super rich, the political establishment and the Big Banks want us to remain in - and their profits are their sole motivation. They care nothing for the quality of life here, or the countryside, both of which will be damaged by further waves of mass immigration. We have just one chance to grab the keys to our prison cell and make a dash for freedom on June 23rd. Let's not blow it. Vote Leave.

This country is cutting its nose off to spite its own face. England will now experience the diaspora of youth and talent that Scotland, Ireland and Wales has always known.
0/0/0	A lot of the pro-Brexiters don't care about their own country let alone Ireland, I think.  This is a fight for a feeling of pride and nationalism and "lost youth" by people who think it won't affect them personally.

1	A quite brilliant speech about the increasing dangers of the Soviet-style EU¬†and its threat to our democracy.
0/0	A referendum based on the Brexit deal with undisputed facts and figures. People need to know that the economy will decline and they will be poorer. The government must also clearly state that the net result of immigration is positive.
1	A referendum was conducted and the result was for Britain to leave the EU. It was a democratic process and should be respected. If these people cannot accept the decision made by the majority, they are free to leave Britain and settled in any of the EU states.

0/0	A tiny part of me says just go for it, crash out and therefore stop embarrassing and demeaning a once great country! Sick of apologising for this nonsense. But then reason kicks in and we have to continue exposing and challenging these imbeciles.
1/1	A trade free zone?! Really?! How about our nett contributions? Is that not a charge for access to your ‚Äúfree‚Äù trade zone?
0/0	A turkey voting for Christmas.

0/0	A vote based, purely and simply, on BIGOTRY!! That's the bottom line.
1/1	A vote for Remain is a decision to hand democratic decision making to people over whom we have virtually no control. #IVotedLeave
1/0	A vote to remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy.
1/1	A vote to stay is a vote for Poverty for you and your Family, as a vote to stay is a vote for millions more immigrants to come to Britain all unskilled and Claiming Benefits of one sort or another. Think of your Family if they need health care or a operation but can't get an appointment because the migrants have taken up all the beds. Think of your Children and Grandchildren when they can't get a job or Training because we are over populated because half of Europe wants to live here on Benefits and free Health care. There is only one way to vote and that is to Vote To Leave .
1/1	ABC is the epitome of what Britain voted against far left/right elite out of touch snobs. Would America really let 26 other countries tell them what they can and can not do. and have unlimited immigration or be called racists. America would no way accept that, so why should Britin
1/0	AFTER WW2 GERMANY ENDED UP RUNNING EUROPE , AND THEY SAY THEY LOST THE WAR TUT TUT!!!!
1/1	ALL workers Voted LEAVE.
0/0	Aah, Brexit was because they wanted to prevent Indians to immigrate? What a stupid bunch...
0/0	About as good an idea as voting Trump.
0/0	About as good an idea as voting Trump. Although at least in America's case the majority didn't vote for Trump.
0/0	About brexit, It all goes to hell
1/1	About time our parliament started standing up for the Uk
1/1	Absolute farce. Remain have killed democracy.
0/0	Absolute fucking horse shit. Maybe for the lucky few. Social mobility in this country is horendous, leaving the european union will only exasperate this problem.
0/0	Absolute, mind blowing, totally avoidable insanity!! What the hell has May done to the UK!!
1/-1	Absolutely ! , I‚Äôve been saying this for years ! üëèüëè
0/0	Absolutely crazy to leave peace and prosperity as a key player in Europe behind. Do you really believe things were better in Britain before the EU. We are far better off in - quality of live, economic and environmental prosperity.
1/1	Accept the will of the people. We voted for Brexit.
0/0	Accordingly once the UK leaves the EU and stops to serve a submarine into the EU disturbing further Integration, the UK will lose most of her importance for the US (and others).
1/1	Actually I would back the British to reject the EU once again. As negotiations progress more and more people are see ing the EU for what it is, even though we are bombarded daily with pro EU propaganda.
0/0	Actually can't stop thinking about fact that we are now at the stage of Brexit where companies are about to stop some global exports, because they take 6 weeks to arrive, and they won't know what Britain's global trading arrangements will be by the time the stuff gets there.
0/0	Actually in a democracy it is the votes that count, whatever the motivation. Remain won the most seats. So remain won.
0/0	Actually it's not a vote for the UK because Scotland will go independent if we vote BrExit so we will be little England again.
1/1	Actually the country, most of us are united in leaving.
1/1	Actually there are a lot of valid reasons to leave -leaving means we regain sovereignty -we have control of our waters so our fishing businesses with thrive -we have the ability to open trade links with economically thriving countries, India, China, America without having to follow the EUs legislations on how much we can trade and the trading policies -the eu won't cut trading with the UK, we import more than we export to them so they would lose more than us through making cuts
0/0	Actually who have suggested te brexit in First place? It really is not a smart move...the World is globalized and be out of it...is...stupidity
1/1	Actually, that's just about the only good thing about delaying Brexit
1/1	After 43 years; time for our independence! #VoteLeave #EUreferendum #voteout #IndependenceDay #votetoleave #brexit
1/1/0	After Brexit is implemented, Members of the UK Parliament will lose the ability to point at Brussels as ‚Äúthe 1blem‚Äù.
0/0	After Brexit it will be like this everyday, probably worse!!!
0/0	After Brexit the next step probably will be the SCexit (Scotland exit from UK).. You see pride and arrogance make people very stupid!
0/1	After Briton falls apart King Arthur will pull the sword from the stone and proceed to drive out the Saxon Horde, uniting all of Britannia in the process.
0/0	After about 40 years of membership the UK is one of the richest countries in the EU and is growing at a satisfactory rate.
0/0	After all the damage Brexshit has caused who on earth is going to follow us
1/1	After all the doomongering about a Brexit no deal the economy appears well set and in comparison with the EU, Italy and Germany in recession, looks buoyant. A no deal seems our best bet especially those with mortgages.
1/1	After decades of economic bonanza in the E.U., Britain is near zero growth now. Surely things will be much better after Britain crashes out of the E.U.
1/1	After expressing clear concerns about backstop needing to be sorted Im backing the Graham Brady amendment- this will empower PM in discussions with EU and give closure which is necessary to deliver the Brexit the people voted for in 2016. Let‚Äôs get brexit delivered!
0/0	After more than two years, the British still do not know what they want.
1/1	After the Brexit, the UK will be more competitive, because the UK can work with other countries to develop trade agreements and laws that are in line with its own manufacturing. We should leave the European Union
1/1	After the absurd amount of regulations, and dangerous legislation like Article 13, it's a wonder anyone would want to stay in the EU.
0/0	After the racist disaster that was the Tory conference and the poisonous remarks by Amber Rudd which has enraged the moderates in the UK, the country is probably something like 60% Remain and 40% leave now...
0/0	After this week‚Äôs Commons vote, I confess I have never held MPs in lower esteem. Never in my lifetime has the profession so abandoned judgment and responsibility, in favour of personal ambition and party advantage.
0/1	After two devastating wars, the members of the EU were at peace with each other for 70 years. Something that had not happened in Europe in recent (and also not so recent) history.
0/0	Again Britain's exceptionalism and arrogance. The UK is not a teamplayer.
0/0	Again. I'm a Londoner sending my most heartfelt disdain and hatred to #brexit. There are 8.65m of us. #StopBrexit
0/0	Against Brexit....Against Trump.  Maybe Oliver should stop telling us what he's against so much, he seems to have a bad track record.
0/0	Agitated leavers should note that most EU migrants did not cost the country for their education, will not do so in retirement and pay lots of tax despite being low users of public services. In other words, they subsidise the angry Kippers who are all hot and bothered about imaginary concepts of sovereignty. Better think who is going to pay to keep the country running. I don‚Äôt hear Farage or Boris providing that answer.
0/0	Agree - vote for any party that is anti-brexit.
0/-1	Agree whole heartedly as the so called leader of the UK she is pityful. Backs party and the privilege classes above everything. Ignoring" the will of the people"!!
0/0	Agree: Stop Brexit!
0/0	Agreed and likewise ! Trust is broken - smashed - and every time a 2nd world war reference is made I feel sick . I always suspected this , but never has it been so clear . UK is obsessed by 2 world wars and 1 World Cup. The mere mention hypnotises many into tribal trance mode.
0/0	Agreed, though all this FREEEEEDOM stuff is probably somewhat enabled by other events in UK politics. The English have found a uniquely destructive outlet, is all.
1/1	Agreed. I'm a strong Leave person but after Brexit we want to be good friends with all of Europe, Germany included. Such derogatory terms serve only to agitate. The reality is Germany may be the only one who can steer the EU towards a trade-focused deal that benefits us all. So...apologies. But we do need the German government to listen to German industry.
0/1	Ah mate how can you honestly go to Barack Obama and get him to say Britain will go to the back of the QUEUE really!?! You know what the British people sick and tired of rebuilding Poland: Second World, Cold War and 2008 Crash your country was doing just fine while ours struggled we bank rolled you FACT. Now the time has come to cash our chips you owe us a big pile of cash and we will go to court to get it back you defrauded our benefit system.  Andrew John Metcalf - Commander in Chief
1/1	Ah yes I'm sure that's just what the UK population wants, foreign business people trying to tell them what to do, under the guise of just being friendly to the UK. I'm certain part of the reason we voted to leave was to stop having to take orders from a foreign body.
1/-1	Ah yes..the Bloomberg bias
0/1	Airbus and Ford warn of dire consequences if Brexit goes badly
0/0/1	Airbus has said after the 2016 referendum, if there was a no deal or hard Brexit, they will leave the UK, so Airbus CEO statement is fact not scare mongering.
0/-1	Alas England is not an island.
0/0	Alas it would appear that the generation that I belong to all of whom economically benefitted from the 80s and 90s, disproportionately, decided that future generations should not have the same benefits and voted Leave!
0/0	All Brexit can say agsinst any advice to remain is Project Fear, Sack Him etc etc, Brexit don't want t hear anything but their own voices and they still can't give us any plans post an EU exit.
0/0	All Brexit does is take power from the EU and hand it to the cold, hard-right tories.
1/0	All Brexit does is weaken Europe as a whole, thus weakening the democratic stronghold of the world.
0/0	All Brexiteers are living in the past; some in the 19th Century, some at the height of the British Empire, and some of them in June 2016; none of them accept that the country has changed.
0/0	All Brits are forever stained as entitled morons apparently
0/0	All I can say it's that we live in a world that it's conneced wether we want to admit it or not and since we are bond, we are like a chain, one country can harm the rest of the ones that are near by, so I belive that the UK leaving the EU will be a high toll to pay in the near future and the worst part it it's not a win-win to anyone.
0/0	All I can see is the UK, losing out in a huge way in the long run. This is a example, of people not appreciating, or understand what they have. The general UK public are ignorent, of the EU because they are not told or explined, what the EU is and the benefits that it gives them. All they hear and get through the different media's are all of the negatives and bias reports through the media . The EU, is the future for all the European state's, it's for the next generation , and the generations to come.
1	All MP.s should lose a day's pay for every day after the 29th March that they fail to deliver what was promised in the Referendum result.
0/0	All are welcome please ignore Brexit bigotry
0	All because the little Englander's xenophobia got the best of them. Sad to think that a lot of people had made their minds up before the election or any campaigning. Today, we have truly gone backwards as a nation.
1/1	All citizens of free  Democratic Constitutional Republics must beware of leaders who are willing to sell their sovereignty for currency & trade their liberty for security. Congrats UK on your Independence day.
1/1	All hail Britain! May she be Great again!
1/1	All i've heard is that if Britain leaves that may mean more jobs for the other countries that will take Britains side of the trade so i'm down with that, i live in Italy and we need more jobs here so gtfo britain.
1/1	All leave voters should boycott a second referendum in protest.
1/0	All liberals need to be rounded up and locked in a mental asylum.
0/0	All of which is perfect confirmation of why important and complicated matters like EU membership should never be trivialised and presented as a simple yes/no decision in a referendum.
0/0	All problems he mentioned are not related to Brexit, nor the EU. Simply failing of UK politics. Brexit will not improve the situation in the small rural communities, it will make it worse.
1/1	All the British people  want is for brexit to take place so the country can be INDEPENDENT  again. In politics INDEPENDENCE is sacred and unnegotiable
1/1	All the benefits, hardly.  The EU's policies have consistently delivered a weaker economy and worse economic performance than England, the currency deficit between the Euro and the Pound is just one example of this.   On top of that, the governance policy and structure makes it essentially an autocracy where the highest governing offices are not elected, and are not answerable for their actions to the general public.  Hell, the EU parliament only  have voting rights on bills put forward by the unelected council, they can't propose motions on their own.  Beyond that, the economic impact the leave is likely to have on England's economy is greatly overstated.  Yes there is likely to be a downturn, but it will most likely be far less disastrous as anti-brexiters would have people believe.  I believe the chance to free oneself from the autocratic, and economically inferior governance of the EU is worth the associated risks.
0/0	All the brainless losers who want a Brexit should have sign a contract saying they will put 50 grand each in to a kitty to refund us remainers when all these predictions of disaster turn out to be true. As Brexiteers all say this is just lies they can not have a problem with that because they will know it can not happen. Fair enough?
1/1	All the doom and gloom and crying for a do over the media push for said do over the fake google stories, the "oh you will never leave" followed by the "oh why even bother voting you wont win" and now "h-ahaha you messed up bet you want another go" all of that crap and here we are.  It has been one day, and we are looking better than ever.
0/0	All the fishermen want out, but sell 90% of their langestines etc to EU. Brexit is bonkers.
0/0	All the old people who voted Brexit will be the first in the supermarket emptying the shelves
0/-1	All the while our parents generation are happy getting exactly what they voted for, while they're totally insulated from any of the effects. Sickening.
0/1	All these companies will end up moving to somewhere besides Europe and the U.S. because of bad decisions being made all based on nothing but stupidity at the highest levels. I am glad I am old and do not want to be here as the decline of democracy unwinds.
0/0	All these elderly that voted to leave will die and will leave UK broken. I feel really sorry for the young people, that need a good future. Uk need new election as soon as possible. The country is divided, that's sad!
1/0/0	All this "Brexit Crisis" documentary and news briefing is designed to "educate" the electorate ahead of a second referendum so that all those who voted leave in the 2016 referendum will vote sensibly so that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.
0/0	All this complication and expense, just so that old English people can feel like they stuck it to the Germans.
1/1	All this fear campaign demonstrates the desperation of the Remainers and the EU who have special interests. Where was all this fear campaign during the referendum?
0/0	All this nonsense about things somehow being the EUs fault. What utter delusion. At no point, ever, did we have any leverage - we have none now.
1/1	All those who want to remain in the EU, should be automatically be signed up for the new EU army, let‚Äôs see how many banners would be dropped then
0/0	All voting is fixed. Soros made a fortune on Brexit. The decision was made by the psychopathic elite to fit their agenda and fill their pockets.
1/1	All we want IS to get out of EU the sooner the better.
1/1	All we want is British Sovereignty returned to the People.
1/1	All you need to do is read the various EU Treaties (starting with the Treaty of Rome 1957 right through to the Lisbon Treaty) to see the absolute monster we've voted out of!
0/0	Almost all UK chicken producers would be wiped out by Trump‚Äôs excrement-covered birds, but if any of them (farmers not birds) voted Brexit you can be sure that they knew wot they wuz vo‚Äôing for - the dole q.
1/1	Almost all of the people where I work are Poles,, Romanians and Hungarians :(( only me and 1 other English person, It doesn't feel like England anymore :( I vote leave not because I am against immigrants, but because i feel that there is a limit to how many we can take
0/0	Almost every multi-national corporation will move outside of the UK. Stupid ass idiots got duped into believing Brexit was for the best. Thanks Putin.
1/1	Already about 5 big Merchant Banks have announced investment in the City of London - and that's after Brexit.  We had all these scare stories the first time around about not joining the Euro would destroy the City and Stock Exchange - it didn't.
0/0	Already every bad consequence of Brexit or no deal has been blamed on the evil nature of the EU, it was inevitably going to go this way as their whole campaign to leave was built using the EU as a scapegoat for their own ineptitude and poor domestic policy decisions.
0/0	Also, had a friend who runs a Belgian inspired beer bar and thought there were to many immigrants, despite his bar being fully staffed by eastern Europeans.  I don't think you'll get a rational answer to this.  Edit: both cases are people who said they voted leave.I Being an EU citizen, I didn't really know too many people in that crowd.
0/0	Also, polls show that the remain side is dominated by under 35's, with the leave side being significantly older. It's our generation that will be impacted by this decision, and unlike the xenophobic dinosaurs, we don't want to be stuck in a little Island with a wall built around it!
0/1	Although I think Brexit will be a disaster for the UK, in economic and politics, I think the referendum was legitimate.
1/1	Although leaving EU has a terrible consequences, but for me it may have promising benefits from it years after the leave itself--the UK may establish diplomatic relations and trade treaties to the commonwealth and other non-EU countries of interest, like Japan, Iceland, Norway, Chile or the Philippines to rebound their economic status
1/0	Although many of the people voting to leave are educated and smart I'd say the majority of them are closest racists.. There I said it
0/0	Always said 'Industrial workers' voting for Brexit were Turkeys voting for Xmas
1/1	Am I getting a bit ahead of myself here, but does the prospect of leaving the E.U. without a deal look better and better?
1/1/0	Am an indian and i believe the people voted for brexit are the real british.....No nationalist wanted to see their country becoming another Pakistan
0/-1	Amazing to discover that 100% of the general public in the UK appear to have Ph.D‚Äôs in international trade. The country‚Äôs economic future is undoubtedly assured.
1/1	Amazingly Switzerland has 5 borders with the EU without a hard border
1/1	American has always sided with France at the cost of U.k since their revolution and WW2 When the French sent their gold too the U.S until after the war .They then left U.K to fight unill we were bankrupt after that at the very end of the war they finished the job we started and put us into moral and financial debt and at a distinct disadvantage....So in short don't trust them you mug's! VOTE OUT E.u-mess !
1/0	An ORB spokesman said: ‚ÄúThe poll shows that there is substantial support for pushing through with Brexit despite the potential consequences for the Union.
0/-1	An advantage of Brexit is the lessons everyone else is learning.
0/0	An insane amount of money that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of just how much Brexit has cost the nation so far.
0/-1	An orderly Brexit depends on a united Tory party. So start stockpiling now
0/0/0	And Brexit is the mistake people never realised they made.
1/1	And I did get up in 2016 - to vote leave Brexit!
0/0	And Leavers think it's a good idea to leave the EU without ANY trade deals...
1/1	And about going ‚Äòback to Europe‚Äô the UK is part of Europe and always will be - it just won‚Äôt be part of the EU numpty!
0/0	And about to get a whole lot worse, as May is clearly stupid enough to trigger Art-L and go for a Hardshit Brexshit!
1/0	And after 'extra-time' it will go to penalties, and Germany will win.
0/0	And as regards all these EU laws and regulations that are supposed to blight my life, I have never come across any of them.
1/1	And for a little context ask yourself why these people want to remain?? business interests maybe? shares in places abroad?
1/1	And hopefully we then leave without a deal and it's a clean break
0/0	And idiots completely fell for the lie that is Brexit
1/1	And just to think there‚Äôs people in the U.K. think this vile organisation is wonderful.
1/1	And many millions like me will be rejoicing at finally no longer being tied to the corrupt EU. The EU know we will be successful the reason they what to make it as difficult as possible to leave.
1/1	And never look back. EU has lost control of its borders. It's not too late for England to protect hers.
0/0	And now millions of people in the United Kingdom are denied the right to easily travel, work and attend school in other EU countries. And the currency's worth is at its lowest point since the 1980s.
1/1	And so like 1642 and 1776, 2019 is a date that a free people will remember. That or war
0/1	And so the betrayal of the British People Begins.
1/1	And so what? Britain has a decision. For good
0/0	And stop presenting the EU as doing a no deal. The UK decided to leave, remember. All failings will be down to the leaderless Tories. Do t even try to blame the EU, you can try though.
1/1	And that is why the EU will ultimately fail to deliver ever closer political and economic union, it's going to make Europeans poorer.
0/0	And that's how Britain got screwed.
1/1	And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists.
1/1	And the Stop Brexit campaign continues. YOU LOST get over it!
1/1	And the blind remainers cannot see the way the EU treat the UK we are just Cash Cows out and stuff them and their cars Japanese are just as good
0/0	And the breixt voters still think they know better. If brexit does finally go through then it seems that the first problem the government of the day needs to tackle is eduction for it is clearly in a catastrophic state if so many in the country will continue pursue brexit despite the truth being known about all the leave claims and the conduct that has been uncovered.
1/1	And the more the EU tries to hardball the UK, the more we are going to want to leave, and pay back the EU for its unfriendliness.
1/1	And then the PM decides that the vote was wrong and we‚Äôre still stuck in the same situation today.
1/1	And there you have it ladies and gentlemen of the remain campaign. From his own mouth. How much more do you need to hear and see? Grow a pair! We need to leave!
0/0	And they will loose all the benefits of open borders. At least I hope the EU will be strict in such cases and quits all treaties so the British people can FEEL that the EU didn't only wanted money of them and gave them a lot of economic advantages they will miss.
0/0	And thus a decision was made that would massively screw over the country for years to come.
1/1	And we are fed up with career politicians who have no experience of the real world
0/1	And we want to leave the EU? It beggars belief.
1/0	And what about the will of the people? Remember them? The ones who voted to leave the EU by referendum? Oh that's right, I forgot you're an authoritarian cuck disguised as Mr. Bean.
1/-1	And what you expect when there are 9 muslims in the parliament
0/0	And why are they ignoring their own assessments that any Brexit will leave us all worse off? The only outcome that "betters the lives of British people" is to Remain.
0/1	And yet, for all this "engagement" from the leavers, not one man Jack amongst them has managed to put forward a single compelling benefit of leaving, for however many years this has gone on.
0	Another American here. Sounds like that famous, European self-righteousness, smugness, and sense of superiority has rubbed off on you. Must be something in the water over there. No wonder the Brits want out
1/1	Another brexit scare story put to bed
0	Another global financial crisis is coming
0/0	Another opportunity lost. This is what happens when you make plans to leave the world's largest trading bloc. Watch the Brexiteer politicians who sold this snake oil to the country yet again blame everyone and everything other than themselves.
0/-1	Another vote (Brexit) which was strongly manipulated by Russian military intelligence in order to create chaos. It's working there too
0/0	Answer: Don‚Äôt leave the European Union.
1/1	Any 'DEAL' means we're still IN !!!!!
1/-1	Any club (European Union) that wishes to deliberately punish a member for leaving sounds more like a gang to me....blood in and blood out. Why should the UK be threatened and punished for simply wanting to leave the club? I feel sorry for Italy and Spain who's economy would be completely destroyed by the all powerful EU (Germany and France) if they decided to leave. So let's say this again.....A club..that when you wish to leave..you get punished..... Can nobody else see that?
1/0	Any company moving from the UK due to Brexit, Brexit uncertainty or any other claim to Brexit should be boycotted by the UK public.
0/0	Any decent politician would now be saying that whilst it's clear many people voted to leave, we cannot reach an agreement that will truly be in the best interests of the country & bring the people from both sides together. We must therefore #RevokeA50, #Remain & reform within.
0/0	Any evidence to support your rhetoric? Unicorns are not real BTW.
0/0	Any financial forecast is guesswork from either side. I think you've got to Base this on what sort of person you want to be, insular and fearful of outsiders and collaboration, or open and willing to help and work with others. I also do think you have to look at who is campaigning on either side, if you want to align yourself with Nigel Farrage and Michael Gove then you get what you deserve.
0/0	Any form of Brexit makes our security harder to manage.. The harder the Brexit, the greater the damage.
0/0	Anybody thinking a no deal is good is just ignorant on economics and trade. The British can not be trusted and the world is watching on how they conduct themselves.Who would do a deal with this backsliding country.
0/0	Anyone aged over 50 must not be allowed to vote in the referendum. It is not their future to decide.
1/1	Anyone else fed up with the propaganda from these Common Purpose led political clowns?
0/0	Anyone else find it interesting that LEAVE voters type like TRUMP?
1/1	Anyone in their right mind should vote to leave the EU political union, we want their trade, not their politicians and policies.
0/0	Anyone now supporting a 'no deal' Brexit is a threat to my family, business and the country. It's becoming quite clear that they are prepared to accept any degree of damage to the UK and its people, including loss of life.
0/1	Anyone planning a party? This should be the biggest celebration of your life's!! 29 March 2019. #Brexit
1/1	Anyone who opposes Brexit is a fascist
0/0	Anyone who supports Brexit is an idiot
0/0	Anyone who thinks brexit will help trade is a moron, if India wanted anything we have they could buy it already, cutting the cost of British wine by 5% isn't going to do a god damn thing
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Anyone who voted for brexit should be sent to a mental asuylm then be shipped off to prison for 3 life sentences to be served back to back for crimes against the people of the UK
0/0	Anyone who wants a no deal is someone who will make a lot of money at everybody's expence.!
1/1	Anything is better than bowing down to a bureaucratic super state that hold democracy and individual freedom 2nd to their dream.
0/0	Anything is better than brexit.
1/1	Anything that hurts the EU is a good thing.
1/0	Apart from that, the people of the UK should be able to hold their elected representatives responsible for events bought about by bad policy. The way I see it, you can't do this because EU bureaucrats in Brussels actually call the shots.
1/1	Apart from the traitor and war criminal Tony Blair, Theresa May has become the most hated PM in this decade. If she forces another eu referendum she can count me out, as I will NOT vote again as I already voted to leave, and my vote is still the same. I hear people crying on the streets of Britain, "Off with her head".
0/0	Apparently the Tories refuse to accept reality. Either that or they actually WANT to destroy the country.... which I hope is not the case but I suspect it is.
0/0/1	Apparently the pickle pizza is just as divisive as #Brexit...
0/1	Arch-Leaver here: agree, esp. re: minority of Britons being xenophobes, however, they voted in '16. I'd probably say it's because we are an archipelago of diverse peoples that we're so outward looking, liberal and tolerant. Additionally ‚Äî isn't our Union the (pretty much) the least xenophobic state in the EU28?
0/0	Are there any real pro brexit arguments that aren‚Äôt about tax avoidance or hating the foreigners?
1/0	Are they Deaf Daft Or just Dumb. We don,t wan,t a Customs Union free trade WTO now.
1/1	Are you in or out? Does the UK really want to be governed by people that are unelected?
0/0	Are you seriously this ignorant? You've let this "can't happen to me" bullshit get in your head. Brexit shouldn't impact me with any significance either(as far as I can tell) but the way things are going it's going to fuck a lot of people. If you can't recognise that reality, you are very fucking naive. It's not out of character, Leave voters seem to be oblivious to the fact that their decision is going to literally cost some people their lives if we crash out of the EU.
0/0	Are you sure you want to take away the rights of free movement, throw away trade deals, put unity and stability of EU at risk and jeopardise the integrity of UK?
1/1	Are you willing to put on a Yellow jacket and take to the streets if the 29th of March isn't the date we leave the EU in essence #Brexit #UKIP
0/0	Around 3.5 million British jobs are directly linked to British membership of the European Union‚Äôs single market ‚Äì 1 in 10 British jobs.
0/0	As Britain has declared its intent to become a total outlaw country, the black market will thrive and the legitimate economy is finished
1/1	As Churchill famously stated in Parliament in 1953 We have our dreams and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it.
0/-1	As EU-citizens we would like to participate in the referendum and vote for Brexit.
0/0	As I predicted - Brexit is going to be one phuck of a train wreck.....
0/0	As Nissan scraps plans to build their X-Trail model in Sunderland, I'm reminded that 61.3% of people there voted for Brexit. And this is how some of the idiots celebrated. I'll be saving my sympathy for people who deserve it.
1/1	As a Brexiteer I must vote this biased analysis down. You didn‚Äôt even try.
1/1	As a Brexiteer I say good. Nobody wanted May's pathetic deal and she couldn't be trusted to get us out of the EU.
1/1	As a Brit living in the Netherlands, Britain really will benefit long term with a No Deal Brexit. Expect Italy or even France to follow in due course while the Brits get out their popcorn.
0/0	As a Brit, I see the UK situation as just as embarrassing as the US situation. It‚Äôs possible to laugh at both.
1/1	As a British tax payer why should I subsidize countries in eastern Europe and why should they lose all their professional elites to us. The EU is not working.
0/0	As a British, after Brexit, we are not free to travel in Europe, I hate Brexit.
1/1	As a Chartered Engineer, I can assure you we're well skilled to look after UK's engineering needs.
0/-1	As a European (from the UK) I would be on board to make one superstate in Europe but I know most other people don't like that idea because they feel the culture from their country will fade
0/0	As a European l have to say goodbye and good luck being Trumps sock puppet. You only have yourselves to blame
0/0	As a German I am fully prepared to help the Irish. We're a union, not a ramshackle political garbage dump, and unlike such a dump we keep our promises.
0/0	As a UK citizen living in the EU I'm terrified of this outcome as I haven't lived in the UK for almost a decade. They would literally have to drag me kicking and screaming to return there.
0/0	As a UK resident/tax payer but Swedish citizen I can't vote today. But I can show where I stand. I'm in. #VoteRemain
0/0	As a citizen of the Czech Republic, I'm so for the idea of a bigger political organization where everyone is equal. I'm not saying I want Europe to be one country. I just wish people realized that all European nations have so much in common and that together we are stronger.
1/0	As a citizen of the US, it makes me feel a bit better. Sort of like seeing that your friend also hadn't studied for a major exam.
1/1	As a developed country, I don‚Äôt think we need to accept EU financial integration. This is obviously a disadvantage for us.
1/0	As a french, I can tell you than none of us want you to stay. Frenchmen have seen your first vote as a treason to the cooperative project between all the european's nations. That's why we hope that you are not going to have a second vote and are going to leave the EU without any deal or with a deal in EU's leverage.
0/0	As a law student, we're staying IN !
1/1	As a lifelong Conservative voter, I am appalled and disgusted by this abject surrender by Lord Halifax..., sorry, by May, to the EU bullies. At least the USA has a leader that stands up for his own people and country. May and her gang of traitors have betrayed the British people yet again. Whether it's Brexit, multiculturalism, islam, crime, defence spending or half a hundred other topics that vex and dismay the people, you can be assured our smug self satisfied political elite will subvert or ignore the people they supposedly represent.
1/1	As a part of the younger generation I'm NOT sad about this. So relieved to be out of the anti-democratic, protectionist, corporate bureaucracy that is the EU.  We're a free global nation again, not locked away as a prisoner in fortress Europe.   Hello USA, Hello China, Hello India, Etc. :D
0/0	As a pro-EU person I acknowledge that Brexit Britain will be fine. Well, at least depending on what ‚Äúfine‚Äù means to you. If ‚Äúfine‚Äù means ‚Äúno doomsday‚Äù, like people starting dying in thousands and unemployment jumping to 50%, then I agree, there won‚Äôt be any doomsday. But economy will take two hits, one stronger short-term hit and one weaker long-term hit.
1/1	As a small business owner who believes in British democracy, but mostly as a father #IVotedLeave  ‚ÄúI am not afraid of the future.‚Äù
0/0	As a teenager (who is going to have to deal with the consequences of Brexit but not knowing a thing about what is happening) this video was extremely helpful
1/1	As a young Briton, there is no better choice than to leave the European Union.
0/0	As always, the uninformed poor (as in the mafia bank$ter$ '08 ongoing crash) desperately grasped at an anti social Rightard straw - and got a sub prime-Brexit!! Good only for even more mafia bank$ter$ - like Farage!!
1/1	As an American, I just hope they can escape article 13, for their own sake.
0/1	As an American, even I can see this is biased. I support Brexit, a country who doesn't want to be part of a collective deserves to be free should the citizens say so, and the citizens have said so.
1/1	As an American, even I can see this is biased. I support Brexit, a country who doesn't want to be part of a collective deserves to be free should the citizens say so, and the citizens have said so. We did it in 1776, you guys are doing it now. Well, you're different, but we're sort of like that. I know a lot of Americans support Brexit, and I hope this follows through.
0/0	As an Aussie I can‚Äôt stop watching these videos. Brexit is like a slow motion car crash that you can‚Äôt look away from
0/0	As an EU citizen, I am disappointed that the UK does not want to work together. It's a we want but do not give mentality, where all parties can only lose
0/0	As an European I always looked at the British people and culture with appreciation but when I see the comments and argumentation of the majority of the Brits here I realize how wrong I was. Some are complete imbeciles
0/0/0/0	As an European, i think it is very stupid. Brexit shouldn't happen and they should stay with us.
1/1	As an aside, I wonder how many people who voted for remaining were scared into that vote by the economic fear factor that turned out to be pure fiction?
1/1	As an individual there is one thing I can do for the country on June 23rd Vote Leave, and I will do.
0/0	As clear as mud! The vote that gave the U.K. Brexit is the same kind that gave the U.S. Trump. Clueless people talked into mindlessly deciding something in their worst possible interest.
0/-1	As far as I can tell, the leavers just made a very uninformed decision.
0/0	As if Brexit was an economic vote, give me a break. It was a hate-filled xenophobic vote and that‚Äôs it. The older generation would rather see its own kids and grandkids deprived than married to gasp an Eastern European. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not really white, you know.‚Äù That‚Äôs all it is. The fact that we‚Äôll live worse doesn‚Äôt matter to any Brexiter.
0/0	As it goes on so it becomes more frightening. The Brexit debate may reflect the troubles of Europe, but it is also unleashing something far worse. What utter, utter folly.
1/1	As long as Britain leaves the EU Customs Union and Single Market, then it can forge free trade deals with countries around the world
1	As long as Britain leaves the EU Customs Union and Single Market, then it can forge free trade deals with countries around the world.
1/1	As long as we leave on the 29th March 2019 making sure we can make our own laws and negotiate our own trade deals the conservative party will retain my vote.
1	As members of the EU, we're all colonies. They might describe us as Member States now, but the EU is aiming to become an Empire with Germany as the sovereign state.
0/0	As much as I think UK is foolish to leave Eu.. they are an independent country .. EU has to make an example out of UK seriously????? Wtf .. EU looks like a butthurt baby ..
0/0	As right as the picture is, now we should peacefully raise our voices for a 2nd referendum.
1/1	As someone living in the EU, I think EU are being real dicks about this instead of accepting that Britain wants to leave and treating them fairly. It seems the EU is just trying to fuck the British for no other reason than to set an example for other countries who might consider leaving.
0/0	As someone who is from the UK, I think we should definitely stay. I know that the EU is not perfect but I know as a fact that leaving wont make it any better for us.
1/-1	As soon as the shekels start pouring in to the local economy, those bourgeois Bremainers will change their tune, mark my word's.
0/0	As the date of the official political farewell nears (29 March 2019), some activists are talking about halting the process, mainly due to the frozen negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom regarding trade, travel, security, and other areas.
0/0	Ashamed to be British. A country lead by Boris, Farage, Gove and Duncan Smith is not where I belong.
0/0	Astonishing that Leave journos still peddle the myth that there could have been a successful, prosperous Brexit.
1/1	At last some sense in Parliament and at last some hard ball tactics from the UK. Now stick to your guns, not deal, no money. Why has it taken 2 1/2 years of total unrest and business insecurity to reach this point. This should have been our position day one.
1/1	At last someone with a backbone! They shouldn't get a penny unless Britain gets what it wants in return. AND we want our fishing waters back too. If they want to make a trade agreement that is purely about tax and customs, fine, but that's absolutely all it should involve. And as for MORE money that the EU are talking about - it should be 3 billion at most and then we want our assets we've paid into returned as well. Time to stop letting them think they can walk all over us!
1/1	At last we are starting to push back on the EU. Tell them they can go whistle for the ¬£39billion.
0/0	At least that can only last eight years. Brexit is permanent.
1/-1	At least they're not doing irreparable harm to their country by letting an ineffectual and unpopular leader dictate the course of their country's fate in the face of a mounting climate crisis and the numerous political crises of their own ruling party's making like the US..
1/1	At least we can relax, knowing we will be free from being used as a dildoby the EU, who masterbateUs every day to get as much bodyfluid out of us as they can.
0/1	At least we know which direction we are heading in, we know we are heading around the U-bend so there's no uncertainty
0/-1	At least we know which direction we are heading in, we know we are heading around the U-bend so there's no uncertainty.
1/1	At least with all the EU rules removed we can freely go to our local abottoir, and kill a few livestock on site and feed the masses. We can also use up all the wonky non EU veggies, not throw back all the EU illegal fish.. We'll have an abundance of food #Brexit #Nodeal
0/0	At no other time would Brexit have happened, either before or after. It was the unfortunate configuration of the arrogant, lazy and cowardly Cameron who called the referendum, Theresa May with an obsession with immigrants and clamping down on them whatever the cost, and a would be socialist, still living the 1968 Student Union bar uprising, who sees capitalist evil everywhere.
1/0	At the end of the day... The UK's decision to leave the EU, was probably the best thing for the EU!
0/0	At the moment our defence and security rests on Nato, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security... Why should we leave?
1/1	At this moment. Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019. UK GOV PETITION 186,781 signatures Stop Brexit 68,400 signatures SAYS IT ALL LEAVE MEANS LEAVE
0/0	At this point I'm hoping you back out and stay in the EU.
0/1	At this point UK s behavior is insulting to the EU but also irrelevant .Misleading its population is abuse and unacceptable but it‚Äôs solely the UKs own responsibility .It‚Äôs common sense that all negotiations are over and that the UK has to exit completely by the 19 th of March and there is nothing else to address at all
0/0	At what point has it been a good idea? I seriously think we need another referendum.
0/0	Awful hope things change and people wherever they are from who live and work here feel welcome again
1/0	Aye aye give me a break... they doing everything they can to stop brexit.
1/1	BBC and Sky have not let us see many Brexiteer MPs in front of the cameras in the past three weeks, just plenty of wishful remainers fantasising and grandstanding and ignoring the legal requirement to exit on 29 March if no deal is agreed, most of them female career politicians from all parties suffering from verbal diarrhoeiah. What a change to hear the simple commonsense and inescapable logic of the actual position we are in !
0/1	BBC can we please move on from talking about why people voted. We already know you are anti Brexit and anti Leave voter, you don't need to keep proving it to us
0/1	BBC trying to give both sides equal coverage, whilst the Sun, the Mail, the Express, and the Telegraph were 100% partisan for Leave.
0/0	BREAKING: Theresa May scraps... Brexit! Now THAT is the headline we want to see‚Ä¶
1/1	BREXIT & FREXIT and End the Socialist Police State! Take Responsibility for your own Life and Safety! Live with FREEDOM and LIBERTY!

1/0	BREXIT NOW. No free movement of people.
0/0	BREXIT has no definition every single brexiteer has their own definition, you voted for something you didn't understand that's the most dangerous thing about democracy I hope this is one backward, expensive lesson for everyone who voted brexit
0/0/0	BREXIT has profound implications for almost every aspect of UK life - and the science and technology industries are no different.
1/1	BREXIT is a good way to get out bad news
0/0	BREXIT is a madness
0/0	BREXIT is a madness. It was just an empty political scam.

1/1	BREXIT must happen. Democracy must be upheld and outside the EU the country will  thrive on the road of freedom!
1/1	BREXIT no deal option and no payment bring it on then watch the eu implode as many nation's want out that haven't been given a vote
1/0	BREXIT will not make Britain poorer - it will make Britain much wealthier.
0/0/0	BREXIT without a deal is going to hurt both EU and UK but undeniably UK will be the one much worse off. In the end it will strengthen EU because it shows the folly of throwing a tantrum and leaving.
1/0/1/0/0/0/0	BREXIT. Enough brits got sick and tired by being pissed on by the rich and powerful that they decided to piss on themselves.
0/0	BREXSHIT boring now everything will come out in the wash.

1/1	BRITAIN: save yourself.... leave EU.... GO BREXIT GO!!!!!!
1/1	BUT when it does happen it will be a catastrophe for your children and your children's children if we remain. living in a dictatorship run by the unelected proletariat in Brussels and under the heel of the German jack boot this is not scaremongering this is fact as successive government WILL give away our rights to self determination . VOTE OUT
1/1	BYE EUROPE
1/1	BYE UK :D we don't want you in UE, so happy after the result
1/1	Back stop? Excuse ? Get out of the team if your not interested in being a part of it.
0/0	Bad deal for both. But for the EU, the chaos in the UK is a small blessing disguise. It allowed Barnier and his team to have the upper hand in the negotiations, making the EU look like a united front for once.
0/0	Bad idea
0/0	Bad idea...
1/0	Bad things for Britain = Project Fear. Bad things for the EU = Truth.
0/0	Barclays has just been granted permission to shift 190 billion euro of assets out of the UK. Not sure that was on the side of the bus.
1/1	Barnier,Junkner,Tusk three really good reasons to be away from the cesspit called the EU
0/0	Basically brexit is like negotiating for 5 years to move to the house next door which is virtually identical. Utter waste of time.
1/0	Basically our politicians know better than us and are dragging their feet. No deal for the fucking win. Fuck the EU! Yes times will be hard for a while I'm not going to deny that, although I don't think anyone thought we were going to leave and suddenly the economy would shoot through the roof anyway.
1/0	Basically we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit.
1/0	Basically, we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit
0/0	Basically, we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit.
1/0	Basically. The EU has problems there's no doubt. But the misinformation that was spewed by the leave campaign seems to justify a second referendum.
1/1	Be a sovereign nation or be dictated by some unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. I'd take the 1st part.
0/0	Be brave Mrs May say in sorry but we can‚Äôt deliver brexit as it would devastate the country
1/1	Bearing in mind that we were deliberately lied to about loss of sovereignty when we joined the then Common Market
1/-1	Beats me how even the most ardent remainers can still support this bloated intransigent dictatorship !
0/0	Because exactly what the UK needs is a smaller group of dickheads with bad ideas who have even less opposition to their bad economics policies. English people you disappoint me
0	Because naturally clientelism and nepotism are absent or have always been absent of british politics.
0/1	Because respecting the referendum and the principles of democracy is more important.
0	Because the political class is absolutely useless and though we would just sleepwalk into voting remain.
1/1	Because they want to lock us in, we're a cash cow for them and a nation they can dump the Eastern Europeans on.................Lets not forget they've already stated they want to allow 4 more nations in and we know where they'll be heading!
0/0	Because we didn't want you to leave, in the end it would have been so much better for both of us to stay together. ;(
0/-1	Because, even if the political leadership of the UK right now is trying to deny reality, reality will still come crashing down on them on March 29.
1/1	Become independent just like America did
0/0	Been in France for 1 day. Drove 600 miles with no roadworks, everything clean, hotel staff delightful, food perfect, wine incredible, everyone seems to care about their country. We need to be closer, not further away from this amazing place
0/-1	Before the referendum I argued that if we voted leave we would end up worse off and in a situation where we would have to obey EU laws but have no say in what those laws are
1/1	Before the referendum, the EU wanted Britain to take more refugees. Leaving the EU would allow Britain to regain control of its borders.
0/0	Before the unnecessary referendum we were fine. High employment rates. Free movement. Austerity caused by British government impositions following 2008 global economic crash.  Electorate blaming that on EU. Level of ignorance astonishing.
1/1	Before we joined the Conning market our growth was 2.4% we had full employment affordable housing no waiting for doctor's appointments social housing for those who deserved it an NHS coping with demand and we took orders from nobody.....Over 40 years later and 100 Billion Pounds lighter ......Now look at us!
0/0	Beginning of the end for the UK...EU membership issue swung a lot of voters in the Scottish Indy Ref.
1/1	Being an independent nation not ruled by a collective of other countries does have its benefits. UK did well before the EU and I think they'll be ok post EU.
1/1	Being anti EU is not the same as being anti European. Just like being anti Fifa is not the same as being anti football. The EU is corrupt. We are not leaving Europe or the EEA. Just the corrupt EU
0/0	Being in the EU is vital for our generation. So proud that my uni is backing Britain remaining in Europe #StrongerIN
0/0	Being in the EU, Great British startups are entitled to an EU match funded grant. This can bring an additional ¬£250,000 to each startup.¬†After Brexit, we will lose this. Brexit is a disaster for startups!
0/0	Being outward-looking & forming alliances is what makes our city & country so great.  #EUref #StrongerIn
0/0	Being poor and voting to leave is like Uncle Tom giving up the fine clothes to go back to picking cotten
0/0	Being unified by Europe helped smooth the divisions of history, how can Brexit be anything but a return to division regardless of a hard or soft border?
1/1	Believe in Britain, free, sovereign, democratic, global and strong.
0/1	Believe it or not this Pro EU scaremongering was one of the reasons brexit won..... "constantly bullying the leave voters" and branding them "stupid and racist"
1/1	Belive in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it! #brexitmeansbrexit
1/1	Best decision for democracy, well done Britain, from an Irish person. we all know how EU democracy works here in Ireland, how people quickly forget the Lisbon treaty disgrace
1/1	Best thing about this is watching the repulsive BBC-Eurotrash getting more and more upset with each successive result. A roughly six hour trip from smug to distraught that was a joy to behold.
1/1/1	Better a brexit now than something worse down the line.
1/1	Better by far to trade with people who love us rather than the people who hate us.
1/1	Better poor than slave! Freedom has no price!
0/0	Better reject the notion of leaving the EU. It's part of Russia plan. Break up the EU, UK and USA.
1/1	Better to govern thyself that be a slave wariness dried pickles and onions- after so tine pickle taste great and so does onions ....yes the unkonwn is tough and scary but one must remain brave
0/0	Better to stay in the EU dawdling along, annoying the federalists but gaining the benefits of membership until a more evolutionary process brings the EU and UK to a better relationship.
0/0	Bexit is a nonsense in a world increasingly dominated by the big boys: the US, China, the EU, and the rising economies of India, Brazil, etc. Any influence that we had was because we were part of the EU. Who will¬†listen¬†to us?
1/1	Biased media and fake news. If uk is strong and confident, no need to worry for anything.
1/0	Biased, Balderdash, Contemptuous Remainiacs.
1/1	Big Mr Rothschild and his ilk can lord it to us from on high about how we must obey and vote to remain in the EU. The only voice I will listen to is the ordinary man and woman on the street whose wages are being pushed down through competition from migrant workers, and the desperate Steel workers in Port Talbot who are told EU rules prevent us from giving state support to help their industry, etc etc etc etc etc. IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EU. VOTE TO LEAVE - IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR OUR FUTURES!!
1/0	Big deal The government will get their wish (their wont be a lot of fatty's around ) which will be a big help for the NHS
1/1	Big mouth, zero solutions - calls other exactly what he is. Do you job Nigel, do Brexit. I advise all to look into article 24 on Brexit.
0/0	Biggest mistake UK ever made. Let‚Äôs hope a general election reverses the the stupidity
1/1	Bit late on this. should have been done 25 years ago, Oh and maybe they should add criminal background
1/1	Blind beliefs to let unelected eurocrats rule over Europe and have unelected EU Commissions make regulations who cannot be ousted by the people is a terrible idea.    The new Elite Class of Europe live right there in Brussels with overpaid public service jobs who arrogantly dismissed British concerns and interests for decades.   Britain joined the EU decades ago for a trade union, not to give up all national self-governnance and control to eurocrats and 27 other countries.   Unprotected borders, letting in dangerous people and unlimited immigration, overburdening schools, hospitals, housing has been a disaster.  The excessive EU regulations and being a member of the corporatist, globalist EU has cost Britain billions of pounds per year. Leaving the EU wil save the UK billions of pounds, to make free trade deals with any country in teh world and become great like the free and rich country of Switzerland outside the EU.
0/0	Bluntly, the economy will be damaged by people who won‚Äôt live to see what they have helped do. That‚Äôs just not funny.
1/1	Bollocks  I cannot wait  Come on BREXIT  AM NOT PAYING MY MONEY FOR EU ROMANIA IN EU THIS IS CRAZY NO WAY  they are the most corrupt country in this planet,how they are in EU???????    Never come on brexit
0/0	Bollocks to Brexit - the real fight starts soon, make sure we are ready
1/0	Boohoo so we won‚Äôt be able to get the regular ‚Äúbrands‚Äù as cheap as we do? Well here we go we can go back to ‚ÄúSEASONAL VEG!‚Äù And instead of exporting we can feed ourselves Australia have virtually no food import so they guarantee sales if their own produce!
1/1	Borders will be more secure with no deal, not less. Bring it on.
0/1	Boris....right wing... rhetoric...Sir, you're a twit.
0/0	Botched Brexit followed by a hard left Corbyn government. Just disastrous really.
0/0	Brace yourselves for tough times ahead. Those negotiations will not be easy by any means. The EU will ensure the UK is taught a good lesson so other member states do not dare to follow lead! .
0/0	Breakfast, not Brexit. Everyone will be happier.
1/1	Bremoaners should be considered as being "Virtue Signalled". Rather like being Stockholmed. A vote for remain was a vote for Dictatorship. I ask Is the Juncker Reich virtuous?
0/0	Brexin. Remain is the sane option.
1/-1	Brexit
0/0	Brexit & Trump are like the best and most tragic shows of 2010-2019.
0/0	Brexit (and Trump) happened because around 80% of people are not very intelligent. Winston Churchill:"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." But I don't blame them as much as the scoundrels who promote the brainwashing/ propaganda that feeds the fears of these simpletons. Fox 'news', The Daily Mail, The Sun etc work for the wealthy while scoundrels like Farage, Johnson, Gove, Cummings et al also do their bidding. The fact that so many working class voters see billionaire Trump and Lord (snooty) Rees Mogg as 'one of them' is so pathetic as to be almost funny. Almost. #sad

1/1	Brexit by name only. I said it all along!!! I knew what I was voting for. I wanted a hard clean cut. I stand by it more now than I did then
0/0	Brexit can be summed up in 2 words. Complete stupidity.
0/0	Brexit can only go badly. There's nothing in this politics but bad news for anyone. The Leave camp has been thoroughly deceived. Not a single one will get real enough about their project to cost it. So thee is no limit to what it will end up costing us all.
0/0	Brexit cannot happen, if it does, then it will be such a colossal human tragedy. All the families split up. All the businesses shut down. The kids growing up without access to Europe and vice versa.
1/1	Brexit could be a really positive thing, It will allow the 'Europeans' to get on with integrating their countries and creating a new superstate as they clearly want to do.
0/1	Brexit could destabilise the imperial UK establishment and would weaken the imperial EU structure.
0/0	Brexit could have very worse effects on England economy..  :((
0/0	Brexit decision is a disaster!! Email/tweet your MP and demand another referendum! #StopBrexit
1	Brexit delayed is Brexit denied. The British government lied.
1/1	Brexit does not translate into leaving NATO, Europe or the EU. Just like Switzerland has close ties to the EU, so will Britain
0	Brexit doesn't seem very well thought though.
1/1	Brexit doesn‚Äôt need fixing. We voted Leave. No Deal would be fantastic for the UK. All that is stopping it are treasonous politicians who do not want to obey the will of the electorate. Either we leave on schedule and get what we voted for or democracy is dead.
0/-1	Brexit failed.
0/0	Brexit fools. If the UK leaves the EU the FIRST thing that will happen is that the UK will lose its influence as a financial centre.
1/1	Brexit gets better every day.
0/0	Brexit gives me the same feeling of moment to moment dread and powerlessness one feels being in a car with a shit driver
1/1	Brexit happened because of uncontrolled migration over forty years which changed the country beyond recognition and alienated the majority of older working and lower-middle class white voters whose votes tipped the balance in favour of leaving the EU. Pretending otherwise is now a niche industry for centre-left spin doctors in training.
1/1	Brexit happened because the E.U. treated the U.K. worse than a foe conquered in military conflict. They charge us a fee for trading, just like the Mafia changed businesses, they stole our fisheries, putting thousands out of work, they forced immigration upon us, compelling us to financially support families in other countries who would never live here. ONLY enemies usurp a country's sovereignty in this way. TRADING PARTNERS never do this. The E.U. is a criminal enemy to the U.K. and it is high time that this was recognised by our politicians, and they are treated as such. We owe them nothing. They owe us ¬£billions for the years they have mistreated us. Bankers, businesses and Socialists, those who benefit from the E.U. at the expense of our people should hang their heads in shame for not supporting our country!
1/1	Brexit happened because years of complaints from British governments from both parties that the union was obsessed with integration etc were completely ignored. It used to be a great little trading club but then started to get involved with things that were nothing to do with trade. We complained for years and were ignored. So guess what? We left.
0/0	Brexit has actually been a quite good advertisement for the benefits of the EU.
0/0	Brexit has allowed the UK to be almost entirely governed by the right wing parties. I have never been more ashamed to be British in my entire life. Now Scotland and Northern Ireland must show defiance to where the UK is going and leave before we have a Trump like character running our country too.
0/1	Brexit has already cost the U.K. more than its EU budget payments.
1/1	Brexit has already created a new industry. Remainer salt mines! We need to get exporting that sweet sweet salt.
0/0	Brexit has become a tale of woe, capital flight of the order of  800 billion Euros has left the UK because of Brexit.
0/0	Brexit has been a disaster for the UK, France and Spain. It is  a dream that will become a nightmare for other member states as the wealthy states begin to remove their support.
0/0	Brexit has been initiated. This is a sad day for Europe, for The European Union and above all, for The United Kingdom.
0/0	Brexit has completely reset the U.K.s image and reputation. Now it is bracketed with Kaschinski's Poland and Orban's Hungary as a country taken over by narrow minded bigotry, nationalism and xenophobia pandered to by a new government to that is a mixture of chancers and ideologues leading it into penury and isolation.
0/0	Brexit has made Brits `angrier' and `deeply divided'
0/0/0	Brexit has made me ashamed of my country.
0/0	Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine
0/0	Brexit has never been about Britain first. It's always been about a small grain of shady business people first. If anything was Britain first it would be staying in the EU.
0/0	Brexit has proven to destabilizing. The right wing is cancer not only here in america but to all nations around the world
0/0	Brexit has screwed over the British people yet again.
0/0	Brexit has to be painful. Maybe then the UK will learn and rejoin. Leavers got what they wanted, it sucked and now is time to go back begging to the EU
0/0	Brexit has turned into an absolute disaster.. We are the laughing stock of the World!
0/0	Brexit hasn't even happened yet, and it's already a disaster
1/1	Brexit helped us get rid of the rules set by Brussels, some of which even overturned British law.
0/0	Brexit in UK, Trump in America, AfG in Germany, The League in Italy, Front National in France, DPP in Denmark, Democrats in Sweden, Freedon Party in Austria and Netherlands. Are these Alt-Right movements the beginning of the end of Western Civilization as we know it?
0/0	Brexit in any form is going to mean job losses, recession and inflation it's just a matter of how many , how long and how much. We're leaving something we've been in for 40+ years , millions of people have moved countries, thousands of businesses have set up trade links, combined research, agencies,.............  If you don't think this isn't going to cost you're not thinking.
1/1	Brexit is Brexit. No Deal Hard Brexit is what the people of UK voted for and UK Parliament has to deliver. Just get on with it and sort it out.
0/0	Brexit is British pride and arrogance.
0/1	Brexit is Dead ... the hatefest is over!
0/0/0	Brexit is a Trumpian move. Instead of working out a solution that does not isolate the country as a whole. Brexiters should know that Britain is no longer an empire thus it needs allies.
0/0	Brexit is a bad idea. 'No deal' Brexit is lunacy.
0/0	Brexit is a bad idea. Sometimes I hope a hard brexit will happen so that people will actually understand that it does more harm than good, then sometimes I hope it just doesn‚Äôt happen at all.
0/0	Brexit is a cancer not a plague. No one is going to delay food and medicines entering the country. On Brexit fools day the gutter press would be full of pictures of well, normality under "Project Fear" headlines. Over the following days and months Project reality would start to kick in. For example the government would have to choose between 40% price increase on imported food or unlimited free trade with the whole world. It is difficult to see the Government choosing 40% food price increases so imports from the rest of the world would increase and prices of food imported from the rest of the world would go down. Without massive government subsidies British farmers would become bankrupt and we would become totally dependent on food imports from the rest of the world. I take no comfort from the fact that British farmers were more strongly in favour of Brexit than the rest of the country. No Brexit is the only good Brexit. Most people, electors, farmers, car workers and Parliamentarians wish to stay in the EU. Let‚Äôs take back control, save a couple of billion a week and send the Letter of Revocation.
0/0	Brexit is a cancer, not the plague. The UK economy will not implode on 30th march. It starts slow, with lower investments and new businesses who would have choosen the UK, but will chose now one of the EU27 to build a business in europe.
1/1/1	Brexit is a certainty. I voted ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô and the government promised to implement that decision.
1/1/1	Brexit is a chance for British people to make a correction to everything - democratic, economic,social corrections,
0/0	Brexit is a comedy. UK will never decide to exit EU. It will mean more misery than staying in the EU. Europe will wither with EU. EU's bureaucrats will ruin Europe. UK won't stop it.
0/0	Brexit is a complete disaster! The most ridicules referendum ever
0/1	Brexit is a cult. Just based on faith, xenophobia and jingoism.
0/0	Brexit is a death sentence to the party that sees it through.
0/0	Brexit is a delusion, before it really becomes effective you will have economic melt down in the UK and then you will see the clueless politicians May and Corbin running like headless chickens
0/0	Brexit is a disaster for Britain and a small setback for the rest of EU.. in a nut shell
0/0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well. We live in a globally connected world now and those most able to adjust and play the game win. You can‚Äôt insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore. UK will realize this the hard way.
0/0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK but it's what the people voted for.  And even if they didn't know what they were voting for how can that vote be set aside.  But really, truly leaving the EU is really, truly damaging.
0/0	Brexit is a disaster. All you're arguing about is different levels of disaster! If only there was a way to avoid this Brexit disaster? Such as stopping Brexit? It's not impossible to avoid this disaster, is it?
0/0	Brexit is a disaster. Stay in the union. Hold another vote before a hard Brexit. Do not be stupid you pack of old lards.
0/0	Brexit is a disgusting series of lies at every turn. Admittedly the lies led to a one percent majority in an advisory referendum. But from the money for the NHS to the easiest negotiations in history, this hi-jacking of democracy is just that.
0/0	Brexit is a disgusting series of lies at every turn. Admittedly the lies led to a one percent majority in an advisory referendum. But from the money for the NHS to the easiest negotiations in history, this hi-jacking of democracy is just that. This video is just another series of lies, as pointed out in comments elsewhere.
0/0	Brexit is a fiasco of epic proportions, however many other countries are also unhappy with the with way the EU is run by Brussels. Forget Brexit it‚Äôs never going work, forget Remain it just wrong for our nation. We should get together with other member states and push for EU REFORM.
0/0	Brexit is a folly.
0/0	Brexit is a fucking disaster for the world as a whole, fuck you all, you tea drinking, unthinking, pieces of shit x,
1/1/1	Brexit is a gift to us in Britain
1/1/1	Brexit is a good thing
1/1	Brexit is a good thing, time to break up EU. This non-sense union shouldn't exist.
1/1/1/1/1	Brexit is a good thing. Screw the EU
0/0	Brexit is a great idea if you are nuts.
1/1	Brexit is a great victory for the british people and the western world. You're finally taking your country back from the liberal EU that would see Europe turned into an Islamic state. I only wish my own country,the united states, will follow in your footsteps and take back our country as you have.
0/0	Brexit is a hoax, based on lies.
0/0	Brexit is a hoax, based on lies. Lazy people who don't understand the time they live in. In spite of having computers and information available. People are not capable to look further than little me, me....
0/0	Brexit is a huge mistake, a way for the UK to cover up its disastrous voting record on putting total idiots into government.
0/0	Brexit is a joke
0/0	Brexit is a joke.
0/0	Brexit is a joke. The only good thing that might come out of brexit is Scotland might hold another referendum and declare their independence
0/0	Brexit is a joke. The only good thing that might come out of brexit is Scotland might hold another referendum and declare their independence and Northern Ireland might vote to reunify with Ireland Ireland. And maybe even Wales would get their independence though that is unlikely.
0/0/0	Brexit is a joke. The only good thing that might come out of brexit is Scotland might hold another referendum and declare their independence and Northern Ireland might vote to reunify with Ireland Ireland. And maybe even Wales would get their independence though that is unlikely. I would like to see England, Scotland and Wales all re join the EU as separate independent nations. I would say Ireland too but Ireland is already in the EU.

0/0	Brexit is a mess. The politicians who promoted Brexit have ran away. They screwed everyone over.
0/0	Brexit is a national disaster and history will damn the politicians who have brought this on us and our children
0/0/0/0/0	Brexit is a national embarrassment. It is a political project carried out by some very corrupt people who stand to make an awful lot of money off of our suffering. The only patriotic thing would be to put the best interests of the British people first and scrap Brexit entirely.
1/1	Brexit is a new era for Britain.  Maybe it is time for Scotland to stand on it's own too.
0/0/0	Brexit is a painted stool.
1/1	Brexit is a revolution and the revolution has only just begun.
0/0	Brexit is a scam, pure and simple.  Good for elite toffs as they believe it misleads the ultra foolish.
0/0	Brexit is a stupid idea, the European Union is the future, you can turn this around, join the Eu, join the futureBrexit is a stupid idea, the European Union is the future, you can turn this around, join the Eu, join the future.
1/1	Brexit is a symptom. Its not going anywhere however the wn -kers in parliament wish it would . It has been brewing since 1642, 1776 and 1974 . 2019 is just another outpouring of a free people to regain that which has been taken. By violence if needs be.
0/0	Brexit is a terrible idea. There is no good way out of it. They should drop it for sure. It is just as bad as the US electing Trump.
0/0	Brexit is a victory only for Trump, China and Russia...
0/0	Brexit is a warning what happens if one's ego and IQ are inversely proportional
0/0	Brexit is a waste of time since leaving EU would put us in debt.
1/1	Brexit is about Democracy and support for Brexit is as Strong as ever.
0	Brexit is about as good an idea as voting Trump.¬†Although at least in America's case the majority didn't vote for Trump.
0/0	Brexit is about the worse thing the UK could do to itself
0	Brexit is about to be cancelled. The leavers are dwindling in numbers. Sanity spreads among the English for every day that passes. Its simple, you can not govern a nation by pleasing a ill informed mob.
0/0	Brexit is all about the Tory Party and its leaders attempt to please the right wing fanatics at the last election.
0/0	Brexit is all but finished, more chance of Elvis Presley riding down Westminster on a white horse.
0/0	Brexit is all good as long as there's no hidden or confusing clause which haunt us down the line. This offer seems to be flawed already!
0/0	Brexit is an absolute disaster and will make us all poorer
0/0	Brexit is an absolute disaster and will make us all poorer. Voters are not experts and the referendum was just a silly mistake to begin with. It's the ignorant leave voters/no dealers who simply don't understand the negative ramifications of this mess.
0/0	Brexit is an economic suicide!
0/0	Brexit is an expression of english selfishness. Brexiteers don't give two hoots that two nations of the uk voted against; that it threatens the GF agreement that solved the mess the english had created in NI; that it threatens the post war order in europe. They don't give a shit
0/0/0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK.
0/0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK. During the past 45 years within Europe we have increased our prosperity, security and vibrancy as a nation state. London has become the Capital of Europe, The Big Apple of the EU in much the same way New York is for the rest of the USA.  I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out. Demographically these people were older, less well educated, less economically active and from the racist and bigoted  elements of our population. Outside Europe our economy  will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades. These people will  suffer first and most  as the jobs go. The jobs are going already. We just lost an airline (Monarch)  with 2100 jobs because of Brexit uncertainty. Banking job movements to other countries have already started. Dozens of companies planning to move operations to the UK have cancelled the plans. Finally, the real reason that many UK citizens voted for Brexit was racist. There was a belief that too many foreigners were coming to the UK. This belief was most common with the elderly, the uneducated and the ignorant. It was a nasty and racist and pointless backlash against all the economically mobile, hardworking and useful people who were coming  the UK and who have kept our economy warm since the financial crisis. This is an unprecedented case of the population of a major economic power being allowed  to grab hold of the rudder and then steering  the whole lot of us onto the rocks to sink. What a load of Bollocks. STOP BREXIT NOW!!!!!!!!!!

0/0	Brexit is an utter and complete failure either way. At best it'll be miserable. When will these dilettantes and con artists held responsible for this utter mess they created in the UK, costing the UK tax payer many billions already with absolutely nothing to show for it. The exodus of high caliber business is accelerating.
0/1	Brexit is and always will be, the best thing that Britain has ever done for itself. It‚Äôs a victory for the British people.
0/0	Brexit is as bigoted as ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù chatter here, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre citizens have to endure it as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù but shrinking your access to the rest of Europe. I just cannot see that as a good thing. The new taxes and passport mess, pretending this will keep ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù out... the job losses, down swing of the economy.
1/1	Brexit is awesome.
0/0	Brexit is bad for PR and development. Nobody wants to study or move to a greatly diminished Britain. US universities will happily outcompete UK unis for those students.
0/0/0	Brexit is bad for the UK and Europe
0/0	Brexit is bad.
0/0	Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked and served your food today.‚Äù
0/0	Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked your food
0/0	Brexit is becoming a national joke. No longer the "will of the people", with Beregret increasing day by day, we are laughing at the mess that Tories are making of it or we would be if it wasn't fucking the country. Brexit is bad for Britain.
0/0	Brexit is breaking Britain. We must vote down May's deal.
0/0	Brexit is built on lies and cheating. It‚Äôs time to #StopBrexit.
0/0	Brexit is bullSH/T-sold to the general public by RICH liars,supported by the easily conned& promoted by the establishment loving media -name me one Tory policy that‚Äôs helped anyone in Austerity UK !?Homelessness/poverty/ austerity deaths on the rise while the Rich get tax breaks
0/0	Brexit is causing me short term anxiety and long term depression. To the extent that I have lost sleep pondering political and economic scenarios. Scenarios which could lead to my government increasing or abusing powers, a decline in the standard of my food purchases, stagnant living standards, compromised employment protection and reduced residency rights in other EU countries.
0/0	Brexit is economic suicide for the UK.
1/1/1	Brexit is for the British , live with it.
1/1	Brexit is for the best. Brits give more money to the EU than the EU gives back. Until Brits have left the EU they cannot have control over their borders. The trade will be fine as everyone else will leave the EU as well and trade will continue as normal.
1/1	Brexit is freedom. Brexit is getting out of an un-democratic container called the EU. The EU is a flawed, corrupt, undemocratic construct. Yanis Varoufakis (The Greek Finance minister, and intellectual, who resigned a few years ago) says so. He does say that it needs to be reformed from the inside out and does not advocate a Brexit. But from a practical standpoint, the EU is not reformable.
0/0	Brexit is going to be a total disaster, why are we doing this?
1/1	Brexit is going to mean the UK is open for wonderful trade deals that the rest of the world will be queuing up for.
0/0	Brexit is gonna suck for everyone involved. But mostly for the UK.
1/1	Brexit is good exciting and about freedom
0/0	Brexit is good for America not UK
1/1	Brexit is good for UK in the long term
1/1	Brexit is good for UK...If UK is not able to make a deal with EU and get out of EU now,....
1/1/1	Brexit is great
1/1	Brexit is great U.K. will be free soon again
0/0	Brexit is idiotic.
0/0	Brexit is impossible. Your only choice is either staying in the European Union as Citizens or as barbarian servants, rule makers or rule takers. Sorry if for a moment you thought otherwise
0/0	Brexit is just a big pile of shit, can we just cancel this disastrous mess. 2 and a half years for this.
1/1	Brexit is just a country governing itself, just like America Japan and New Zealand. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no hard or soft Brexit, just Brexit which will be a huge success long term.
0/0/0	Brexit is just a sideshow for what is really going on here.
1/1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically.
1/1	Brexit is like Moving House or Changing Jobs, or moving to a different part of the country where you have to meet new friends & find your way around the streets etc. Awkward at first but very soon you get used to it.
0/0	Brexit is like cigarettes. It will damage our health.
0/0	Brexit is like fools gold to all of you Brexiteers.Brexit will cost way more than it is worth too all of you Brexiteers.
0/0	Brexit is madness.
0/0	Brexit is madness. Pure and simple self inflicted injury with no upsides.
0/-1	Brexit is not going to happen.
0/0	Brexit is not going to happend :) :)
0/0	Brexit is not good economic news for either party but I think that the EU will not fall so far as the U.K.
0/0	Brexit is not quite as good as wartime Britain, in a war output has to increase. Our firms relocating abroad. and those that are staying here shutting down, or closing stores, in not the same thing.¬†The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.
0/0	Brexit is not the will of the British people - it never has been
0/0	Brexit is not the will of the people in the UK. It never has been
0/0	Brexit is now a (badly) planned act of national self-harm!

1/1	Brexit is one of the Greatest days of my life.
0/1	Brexit is reaching max lies.
0/0	Brexit is robbing Britain of the best and brightest minds in Europe and beyond. Who would want to come to a xenophobic, inward looking isolationist nation that is just about to commit an act of national self harm? It is time to #StopBrexit
0/0	Brexit is saturating Britain with VENOM, that is Lethal to EVERYONE.
0/0	Brexit is self harm just face it and admit you screwed up .
0/0	Brexit is self harm on a grand scale and the voters who voted for Farage and Johnson's lies will find that out very soon.
0/0	Brexit is sh*t, pushed on the UK by a fake referendum that did not offer a Hard Brexit as s solution at all.
0/0	Brexit is shaping up to be like a divorce in which one the parties is in a manic frenzy to leave and is not going to listen to any counsel about protecting his/her interests on the way out the relationship.
0/0	Brexit is shit, more trouble than it's worth, was based on lies, and overall just creates an atmosphere of shitness across england
1/1	Brexit is simple and harmless. It‚Äôs a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer‚Äôs no. It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren‚Äôt in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
1/1	Brexit is simply a return to national self government as broadly understood to apply to the vast majority of countries which are not members of the European Union. ¬†It is astonishing that we ever abrogated this privilege and even more astonishing that so many of those who aspire to govern us have absolutely no faith in the country whatsoever.
1/0	Brexit is so much more. We need to no deal to escape the new world order and the evil elite
1/1	Brexit is still amazing. Proud of the U.K. from a fan across the pond
0/0	Brexit is stupid
0/0	Brexit is stupid though.

0/0	Brexit is such a catchy name. People fell for that like a catchy music song. The whole situation is really unfortunate.
0/0	Brexit is such a fundamentally flawed idea. They need to have another vote before they go through with this.
0/0	Brexit is such a mess, it‚Äôs quite worrying that the government can‚Äôt sort this out

0/0/0	Brexit is the Fyre Festival of international relations.
1/1	Brexit is the ONLY way we will begin to get control of our huge Mu5lim immigration problem. That alone makes it worth a 'no' vote.
0/0	Brexit is the Titanic of bad ideas. Bon voyage!
0	Brexit is the abyss..so stop believing that GB alone will bring Britons a better life..British colonial ego is the root of all this evil..it is showing that Britons are not capable to live with other Europeans when they cannot achieve or push through in the EU ..they are suddenly angry and behaved like a spoiled child.. Beware! Brexit will dissolve the union and the rest of it will regret this action for decades..
1/1	Brexit is the anti-globalist choice, i don't really see the appeal of the world being ruled under 1 government, some anti-brexit seem hellbent on that point.
0	Brexit is the baby boomers last big fuck you to millenials
0/0	Brexit is the beginning of the end.
0/1	Brexit is the best thing the British has done in  years.  Immigration and EU  excessive regulations  is hurting the British.
1/1	Brexit is the best thing to happen to Britain for a long time
0/0	Brexit is the biggest disaster the British people have faced since the second world war... If we leave the EU it will bring hardships on a scale that will make the 2007 recession look like a rainy Sunday afternoon. People voted for brexit based on feelings, not with their heads. And as a protest vote against the government. I can only hope that some common sense will prevail before we all pay the price for it at the end of March.
1/0	Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK since World War II. People have no idea  how bad this is going to get and the populist arguments on the leave side are frighting

1/1	Brexit is the only solution. We cannot let those morrons destroy our country, England is a stronghold where we stand a chance in the future.
0/0	Brexit is the poisoned chalice given to the younger generations by the older. One can analyse the ins and outs of it and see how much the globalization the immigration hence the loss of national identity and the fears thereof contributed to it all. But in the end Brexit is what the UK has today and it will decide the shape of the country for generations to come. For better or worse this is it! Not a cat in hell chance of going back from here.
0/0	Brexit is the reason the Irish are telling "stupid Englishman" jokes.
0/0	Brexit is the result of an ill-informed public by a deliberately  anti-EU press.

0/0	Brexit is the single biggest misstep in British history, brought about by self-seeing charlatans, and voted in by sheep.
1/1	Brexit is the symptom - EU is the disease. EU will come to disintegrate anyway along with increased forced mass-immigration. To be or not to be - that's the question.
1/1	Brexit is the will of the people
0/0	Brexit is the wrong move for our future, things will get needlessly complicated and it's time wasting. Most of the leave voters were old miserable smurfs in the 65+ age group, their future is as strong anyway. After the referendum, the most searched thing on Google was 'What is The EU?'. I think that just says it all. Not to mention our government is going in the direction of Somalia.

0/0	Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital

0/0	Brexit means no trading deals, less profit to the uk
1/1/1	Brexit means we leave and should be no deals with these EU mongrel dogs.
1/1	Brexit might put democratic reform back on the agenda. I am loving the right wing outrage at the House of Lords and although I doubt we will see PR anytime soon, disquiet with the Brexit dividend in Wales, Scotland, the North and NI might start people taking the idea of Federalism more seriously.
0/0	Brexit must die
1/1	Brexit must take the fight to the Remoaners with a vision of what it would be like if we stayed in the EU. Ugly and disasterous imho.
0/0	Brexit needs to be reversed, this clearly shows the tories and May can't deal with this. We need to get Corbyn in to sort this mess out, brexit is no longer will of the people
1/1	Brexit now with no deal and let Merkel eat her words
0/0	Brexit one of the biggest con jobs on the public in recent times. No one will be getting their money back. It‚Äôs a scam.

1/1	Brexit red lines are constantly being broken. No compromise. We leave end of March with a deal or without a deal. They have had two years!

0/0	Brexit requires zero effort to make it fail. It was a failure at its conception.
0/0	Brexit seems to me an argument for a no deal.
1/1	Brexit should be an easy process but parliament is full of weak and incompetent buffoons

0/0	Brexit was a terrible decision and I'm honestly ashamed that we, as a nation, voted leave
0/0	Brexit was a total dumpster fire
1/1	Brexit was a war. We won
1/1	Brexit was all about sovereignty and democratic accountability. Once we have regained them immigration and the economy can be sorted.
0/0	Brexit was always a mistake from the first. Europe is stronger united.
1/1	Brexit was an excercise in the wise (older voters) rescuing the young (brainwashed) voters from themselves.
0/0	Brexit was and continues to be a disaster and funny enough, the main culprits (boris johnson and that snake farage) are oddly yet not surprisingly no where to be found.
0/0	Brexit was based on fear.  Fear of the other. It was not a rational decision but a reactionary one.  It was bad for Britain and it is bad for the residents of the Commonwealth.  The only beneficiary of the Brexit was Russia.
1/1	Brexit was heaven sent, a mirror revealing the hideous State of the Nation for all to see. The Establishment‚Äôs relationship with the people is an abusive one. With unsound money and measure every communication is dishonest; the public must be deceived for the confidence scheme of created debts to continue unabated. Some even consume bbc state propaganda and expect the truth. Parliament‚Äôs primary objective is to distract the unthinking and bury the real issues under a pile of deceit. You see, claiming the Crown operates a system of free market capitalism doesn‚Äôt survive close scrutiny. Capitalism only works in conjunction with sound money and measure. Capitalism with an unsound currency, like today‚Äôs pyramid scheme of banker‚Äôs debt, quickly descends into Kleptocracy, where markets get rigged and rapid debasement creates rampant structural inequalities, both within and across generations, without the chance of salvation. The ruling elite are unfit for purpose and the case for breaking up this cosy little club grows stronger every day. They cannot be trusted, they‚Äôre incapable of change, and they‚Äôre committed like a cult. Their source of power must be scattered to the four winds. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, unite against the darkness of Westminster and like a light onto the world we shall restore sound money, for the benefit of all, not just the corrupt few.
1/1	Brexit was heaven sent,...." Agreed. As while it shines a light on our Europhile establishment, it shines a much larger one on the EU, its aims and methods. Brexiteers couldn't have done a better job persuading many that voted Remain that they were wrong to do so, than the lesson learned by the Brussels strong arming of UK interests. Far many more want us 'to get on with it' than around the referendum time. No going back now, ever.
0/0	Brexit was like the UK got drunk and accidentally unfriended Europe on Facebook
0/-1	Brexit was not about having a plan, it only ever appealed to enough people by being impossible.  Lets hope the ruin of the UK is enough for these idiots.

0/0	Brexit was the worst thing we have ever done voted for by uninformed people that got lied to by the leave campaign.
0/0	Brexit was the worst thing we have ever done voted for by uninformed people that got lied to by the leave campaign. Same as the people that voted Trump because of all the BS he told them. Scare Tactics and populist nonsense. Brexit will not happen. If it does, its the end of the UK having any influence in the world.
0/0	Brexit wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
1/1	Brexit wasn't about deals it was about leaving END OF
0/0	Brexit wasn't properly discussed and the vote was done in impulse. The margin of 51.9 to 48.1 reflects the unsureness of some of the electorate. Lack of education, discussion, impulsiveness of the topic led to an ignorant vote.
1/0	Brexit wasn't that bad of an idea if it wasn't being negotiated by these monkey.
0/0	Brexit will affect UK economy.
0/0	Brexit will also bring another scottish referendum.

0/0	Brexit will destroy the EU. More will follow! :D
0/0	Brexit will do most harm to the regions especially the North and the poorer more remote regions of the UK. We don't need to leave the EU to decentralise Britain. Very much the opposite in fact. For the last few decades the EU has been the only government body attempting to improve the north of England, while Westminster did nothing.  Brexit is in reality a suicide note from the poor.
1/1	Brexit will happen, Brexit must happen. All the negative talk around Brexit is just fear monger appropriated by the EU.  The EU NEEDS Brexit to fail in order to maintain civility amongst itself.
0/0	Brexit will make us a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access to the single market, almost no influence and few friends

Yeah, I used to think that was a joke. Then Brexit. Then Trump. Nope. It's not a joke anymore.
1/1	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure. Former Czech President Vaclav Klaus has been predicting this for many years,  and every year his data grow more robust.   .

0/0	Brexiteers will destroy the UK. NI will join the Republic after the hard border is established and Scotland will leave and return to the EU and takes its North Sea oil with it.

0/0	Britain always had an island mentality with one foot out of the door anyway. They went with the vote that promised them rainbows and unicorns. Good luck. You're gonna need it.
1/1	Britain and Germany have been propping up the EU. The premise of the EU was to make it easy for a lot of countries to share money... loans and payback... to help with projects that would build up Europe as a whole and make it all come out ahead. The problem arose when money was lent to places like Greece and Italy, it was all spent or pocketed, then when the check arrives they look at it like "wait... you expect me to pay you back? Are you nuts?" Germany's trying to stick it out by providing bail-outs... but you're bailing out countries that have corrupt governments pocketing the cash and have no intention of paying anything back. You might as well toss all the cash on a bonfire. I think Britain finally got tired of this. Good for them.

1/1	Britain doesn't need the EU. it's a burden.
0/0	Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist. The UK has to take the necessary steps to be able to live on its own. brexit is not a good time.
1/1	Britain escaped (the sinking ship that is) Europe
1/0	Britain exiting the EU - "Brexit" - wasn't something that I've ever thought was a good idea, either financially or politically.

0/1	Britain is learning the hard way that threats and intimidation don't work with a large organization like the EU. The EU can lose Britain with not much to worry about. On the other hand Britain is toast without Europe. America, Australia and Canada are far away plus they have their own stuff to worry about.
1/1	Britain is leaving the eu..eu is dead anyway only a matter of time
1/1	Britain is our country! And we took it back today. A democratic country. And we are just trying to protect that and stop us letting so much influence on the decisions we make come from other countries.  Countries that don't know anything about England, it's people, it's culture, it's problems and what the people of England want.  Anyone who thinks Europe will ever be fully united and as one with no tension is living in gaga land. Aka Angela Merkel.  Europe were talking about here. A bunch of countries in the same continent yes but each country so extremly different from the other in so many ways. And we somehow believe we can all get along, all want the same thing so should be governed by a central government that treats us like we have no sovereignty... HELL NO.

1/1/1/1	Britain made the right choice. Down with the EU, long live the Queen!
1/1	Britain must exit. The EU is a failed ideal
1/1	Britain must not only reject Muslim immigration but also EXPEL the Muslims they foolishly already let in. You are correct that there are already enough breeding Muslims to turn Britain into a third world country by 2050. BREXIT!
1/-1	Britain must take back control of our fair share of the EU‚Äôs art and wine
0/0	Britain needs to learn to embrace the world and not to fear it. Today you need Brexit tomorrow you will need Wrexit (World Exit). Britain is not happy with Europe. Are they ever satisfied with anything? The world needs to remove borders not build huge and beautiful walls.
1/1	Britain never really believed in the EU dream. Let them leave I say! Let them be the nation that isnt part of the United States of Europe, the sick man of Europe. I care not.
1/1	Britain never voted to join the EU, it voted to join the EEC back in the 1970's which was nothing more than an innocent trading organisation, not a bad thing exactly. Sadly over the years the truth about the sinister project has come to light and through various ratification & treaties, none of which the people of the UK had a say on, the trading bloc has become an authoritarian political entity that aggressively controls the economies of its members and seeks to promote a pan-European identity. Go back in history and there's a certain German political movement that behaved the same way in the 1930/40's and we all know where that went! In fact the whole European integration idea was conceived by Nazis who escaped the noose at the Nuremberg Trials. There's nothing wrong with nations being free & independent where they can trade exactly on their terms and not receive interference from a bunch of unelected bankers & investors. With the Referendum the people took on the arrogant establishment (that still influences media & entertainment in the UK) and against their smug predictions actually won.
1/1	Britain not for sale Mr Soros. Just because we love our Country doesn't make us racist
0/-1	Britain overestimates its own importance to the EU.I mean England, shit I feel sorry for Scotland and Ireland...
1/1	Britain owes the EU absolutely nothing......No deal .
1/1	Britain resisted a trend for a socialist one world government.....GOOD FOR THEM!
0/0	Britain should ditch the monarchy before EU.
1/1	Britain should just leave without a deal......then, figure it out !!!
1/1	Britain should leave the EU
1/1	Britain should never have joined the EU
1/1	Britain should regain control of our borders
0/0	Britain should remain, the EU needs reform not destruction. You can't have your pie and eat it too.
0/0	Britain shouldn't leave the EU and shut the borders because of fears of immigration.
1/1	Britain shouldnt burn like France. BREXIT!
1/1	Britain standing up for it's sovernity ... God bless
1/1	Britain survived without the EU for hundred of years  and will continue after they leave!
0/0	Britain talking brexit while EU does more free trade with Japan Corea and many other queuing to trade with EU :))
0/0	Britain taught the world really a lesson! Use your brain before you act blond! Prolong the withdrawal period and drag the rest of Europe in your homemade problems???? No thank you Britain! For One time solve your own problems without the EU blaming for your failures and failings!
1/1	Britain wants freedom. People voted. Eu is destroying peoples identity this way it‚Äôs easier to control and manipulate people. I don‚Äôt understand why no one sees this. Britain. Was a strong and vibrant country well before EU. With strong identity and culture. Same like a lot of other European countries that had been affected by this fake ideas of eu
0/0	Britain wants the benefits of the EU without being in the EU. Thats never going to work. Thats why they cant come up with a deal.
1/1	Britain was Master of the World just over a hundred years ago -- and they did it all by themselves while FIGHTING Europe every step of the way. If they could do that then, they can do it all over again now. You have voted to leave, then leave with pride and dignity. No need to grovel for a few table scraps. Where is that famous stiff upper lip? The hell with EU. Make Britain Great again!
1/1	Britain was hesitant to enter into the EU and ever since it has been a bit resentful it even kept using the British Pound over the Euro. Britain being part of the EU has benefited the EU rather than the country its self. Britain prior to joining the EU had been Self Sufficient in its oil and food subsidies. Both had reached an unsustainable level because of the migrant population in the country. All of the people from other countries living there will not have to get a Visa or leave. Again that Benefits the country. They have seen the decline of other countries in the EU like Greece and said, this is not going to happen to us. Britain will not be the last country to leave either. Many People say Germany and Poland are next.
0/0	Britain went down the drain not because of the EU but you did it yourselves. Starting from the government going all the way down to the man on the street. Typical E.G. the car industry. Shoddy workmanship. The british worker no pride in doing his Job. So dont blame the EU for the position that your in.
0/1	Britain will be freed from the EU and taken over by Muslims. Tragic and also hilarious.
0/0/0	Britain will be worse than n korea
1/1	Britain will make BREXIT  a success !! we will create a new Business britain!  lets make a free tax for business for a limited time, keep them here . use the WTo system rules  with china , US  mexico and brazil etc etc
1/1	Britain will make BREXIT a success !!
1/1	Britain will never fall! Britain has allways been some of the strongest country in the world.
1/1	Britain will never fall! Britain has allways been some of the strongest country in the world. And why Brexit? It is all about uncontrolled Migrant crises dictated by Germany and France.
0/0/0	Britain won't recover from Brexit for at least half a century, and that's assuming that the world's geopolitics remains the same ‚Äì which it patently will not.
0/0/0	Britain won‚Äôt recover from Brexit for at least half a century, and that‚Äôs assuming that the world‚Äôs geopolitics remains the same ‚Äì which it patently will not.
1/1/1	Britain would so much better if we left the eu
1/1	Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united europe? I'am sorry but britain was the one disrupting the dream of a united europe.  For example: they didn't take in the euro and they didn't accept the schengen agreement(territory where the free movement of persons is guaranteed).  Two things leading to a better united europe.  We always knew britain was only after the trading side of joining the eu. Thats why they got rejected twice when wanting to join the eu in the first place. The way i see it: We're better off without them.
1/1	Britain's exit is not a blow to "the dream of a united Europe" at all - it is a blow to the corporate elite's dream of undemocratic inverted totalitarianism. The EU must change, an Britain is leading the way to that change.
1/1	Britain's performance has more in common with the economic recovery in the US than the Eurozone. It doesn't really look like we need the EU.
0/0	Britain's role in Europe is to show leadership. Germany and France dominate because we let them. Britain, instead of winging and asking for special conditions for ourselves like a spoilt child, should be obstinately fighting to reform the entire EU - from within!
0/0	Britain, is now completly isolated, bad decision.
1/1	Britain, leave the EU!
0/1	Britain: "Let's leave the European Union! We're going to take our country into our own hands!" Also Britain: "You can't leave the Union, Scotland! You're better off with us!"
0/0	Britain: "we don't want to be in the EU anymore" EU: "ok... well I guess you don't get all these benefits" Britain: " but we want those benefits " EU: " then stay in the EU? " Britain: " ... ... ... no"
1/1	Britan is a great country it will be better off without EU corrupting everything.
0/0	Britian in 5 years Scotland decleares independenc Norhten Ireland unites with Ireland Wales declares independenc bye bye The British Empire xd
1/0	Britian is a dirty girl. She likes it hard and fast.
1/0	Britian is one of the richest and most advanced democracies in the world, it is currently locked in a room babbling away to itself hesteriaclly whilst threatning to blow its own kneecapsoff. This is what nationalist populism does to a country.
1/1	Britian is opening itself up to the rest of the world but at the same time making its own rules. Eu is closing itself of by dictating trading with only eu countries. Thats my 2 cents.
1/1/1	Britian made a good choice hopefully France or Germany will leave next
0/0	Britian will become an irrelevant island in the future
0/0	British are delusional What makes them think They'll be better than 27 countries 300 million plus?
0/0	British are upset that Germany is the superpowers of Europe. you thou ww2 would have destroyed Germany. you thought wrong and their ruling and making more money. the British are just very hateful people.
1/1	British culture? The drunk soccer hooligans who go trash Amsterdam and Paris on weekends? Europe will be fine without them.
0/0	British families enjoy lower mobile phone roaming charges, lower credit card fees, cheaper flights and proper compensation when flights are delayed or cancelled. These sorts of benefits could not be achieved by Britain alone.
1/1	British farms will be back in business and thriving again
0/0	British have lost their mind that's for sure.
1/1	British industry will continue to be shipped abroad (mainly EU countries) thus fulfilling Germany's dream of `putting us in our place
1/1	British people are fed up with legal immigration. The current illegal migration is unstoppable
0/0	British people are starting to say #Regrexit lol
1/1/1	British people believe in this country, vote leave!
1/1	British people don't want immigrants to come into the country not because they are racists but because they take jobs and put a strain on stuff used by the population like schools and hospitals.
1/1	British people have already spoken Britain first now leave means leave, Britains coming home yippee yippee yippee
1/0	British people voted. Leave.. but may wants to stay. There trying to undo democracy. .no point in referendums in Britain. If they dont likd the result the government wont honor it ..
1/0	British political class deserves a hard Brexit. They are lost in their own vanity.?
0/0	British racists are crying because they have lost it! Germany is smart and successful because it is Germany!
1/0	British short-sightedness at its best: by our "Westminister based" government.
1/1	British sovereignty is a rock in an otherwise very shaky European continent which has undergone tremendous problems due to unstable continental European governments throughout history. Great Britain is very much the "watcher", overseeing Europe and always taking the high road when trouble arises. Communists, fascists, socialists, both world wars, expansionist Russia (Crimean War), Napoleon, the Sun King - we have stood up to all of them and won. It's important for Britain - more than any other country in Europe - to remain an independent guardian of freedom and democracy.
1/1/1	British yeah go. You are doing good job i hope you will leave eroupe soon
1/1	Britons might even be able to afford to have 3 or 4 kids again.
0/1	Brits and ties... What are you thinking. But please show Britain out. No deal would be the best for Europe.
1/1	Brits are an example of courage to the rest of the world.
1/1	Brits are happier outside and EU is much better without UK. Leave is real win-win solution !
0/0	Brits have any money for holidays after Brexit and the inevitable economic collapse.
0/0	Brits that still think a no deal brexit is a good idea are so ignorant. I was just watching the results on tv and there were people being interviewed outside, just ordinary citizens, no politicians. A guy said to just have faith in their country, that they'd make it with or without a deal. The ignorance that comes with this nationalism is exhausting.
0/0	Brits the most stupid people on Earth :D
1/1	Brits voted Leave for all the right reasons - its a gesture/indication of Self-confidence and Strength. Don't forget these are the same people that ensured they kept their own Currency when they first ventured into the EU experiment (when they ventured on board the Titanic).
0	Brits voted for Brexit for the same reasons Americans voted for trump ... discontent mixed with ignorance.
0/0	Brits with less than 15 months left on their passports may not be allowed to travel to Europe under a Brexit, it is very inconvenient.
1	Brits, please vote to leave - the States don't need our greatest ally subsumed by an undemocratic, bureaucratic Leviathan - run like the wind
0/0	Brittisch people live with the idea of 100 years ago that they are still a super power. They will become a poor country with no power. With still the same unhappiness about their politicians.
1/1/1	Brtian used to rule the waves, now they are nothing but slaves
1/1	Brussel bullies......we are a strong people and we don't put up with bullies
0/1	Brussels dictates very little on British way of life. It has no say on UK VAT rates, corporate income tax rates, or personal income tax rates. It has no say on UK foreign policy.
0/0	Bulgaria forgives you. Please stay in the EU! We can work on being more romantic!
1/0	Bullsh+t pro EU propaganda !!!!
0/0	Bumps in the road? probably because we wont be able to afford to fix them anymore!
0/0	Bunch of racist who have little regard or knowledge of what a hard Brexit will do to our economy .
1/1	Burn Lisbon, No Deal and remove us from this corpse. It has taken it's last breath and is starting to smell. Move us out of the mire for good.
0/0	Burn your country to the ground because you don't like immigration....brilliant!
0/0	Bury Brexshit
1/1	Business? Brexit is more important even if the British people have to pay the price and are poor - Brexit first
1/1	Businesses have shafted the people for decades, and the EU is the vehicle for shafting us even more.
1/1	But EU is anti-democratic organization, so it makes sense to reject the pessent who think their vote matters
0/0	But I actually agree with what Theresa May said last April;  Brexit would be a disaster for the UK economy and trade.
1/1	But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
0/0	But a System it not helped by leaving it, but by putting effort into changing it. The EU is a product of a political process and not an already finished end-product. I don't understand your argumentation
1/1	But do you trust the European government more than the government of your own country? I would think you have more control/influence over your national government than over that monster in Brussels
0/0	But in fact only 37% of the voting population voted to leave.. no way a majority.
1/1	But it's not about money it's about sovereignty and if the cost is measured in ¬£ or $ it'll be way cheaper than last time we decided we didn't want to be part of a European (German) state. A price many Americans paid for us at that time too. Money isn't everything !
1/1	But its not just the backstop is it its the 39b the 21 month extension fishing gibraltar the falklands and so much more we dont even hear about now all swept under the carpet all extra money for the eu mafia
1/1	But outside the echo-chamber that is the metropolitan liberal class, the real people of Britain saw things differently
0/0	But the EU is going to ban cups of tea, front doors, water, and air. So I heard.
1/-1	But the Remainers told me they'd be massive Visa Fees ? You're telling me they lied? :/
1/0	But the U.K. can use memes freely. Who is the real winner here?
0/0	But you are free to dream further of your Lala land where the whole world is on its knees to get granted some breadcrumbs by the British empire. I am sure that times are long gone by now.
1/1	Buy British : beef, pork, milk, butter, apples, lamb, fish, cheese, new world wines, British clothing, British US and Japanese cars, holiday in UK or Commonwealth, UK beers, household items, fly BA if at all.
0/0	By Brexit the UK shot itself in the belly when fishing.
0/0	By all accounts we (as a whole) think brexit is a mistake and would vote to remain in the EU.
0/0	By disrupting 45 years of agreements and treaties the UK are causing unnecessary chaos.
0/0	By leaving the EU your damaging the economy, so many businesses have chosen to leave the UK due to the possible ramifications of this decision. A start up company that I worked for had to fire hundreds of employees due to them having to relocate as a direct result of leaving the EU, as most of their products were sourced from Europe. I swear there needs to be an IQ test before they allow people to vote. Bunch of thick scrounging scum bags get an education and maybe people from other countries wouldn't have to do "your" jobs for you !
1/1	By leaving, we will again be able to determine who does and does not enter the UK
1/1	By staying in the imperial dictatorship of the EU. That is medieval!
0/0	By voting for Brexit, I think we are on course to make Britain inhospitable to many foreign workers who help our country function.
1/1	By withdrawing from the EU, we can organise economic and social affairs in this country not by deliberate design from the top down
1/1	Bye Brits ,just go with your arrogance and racism. EU owns majority of your companies ,so guess where they will go after Brexit.
1/1	Bye Bye to a corrupt European Union
1/1	Bye bye EU your worthless
1/1	Bye bye EU!!!!!!
1/-1	Bye bye EU.
1/1	Bye bye, no deal no money. Times will be hard for a bit but we‚Äôll come through. Have a good life EU
1/1	C'mon Britain let's tell every one you know that leaving is the only way of saving this country's proud proud history and giving our children and grandchildren the chance of a free future
1/1	CK1I knew someone would pop out on this one , just shows. Vote out
1/1	Call there bluff, watch the EU come running.
1/1	Calling a second EU referendum will further damage the government proving does not listen to the will of this country. The people of the country have voted out and this needs to be respected and honoured  The public has cast their votes and voted for a Brexit. This should be respected. If the EU referendum had resulted in a remain vote coming out as the majority then the leave campaign would not get a 2nd referendum. Whatever the result for the referendum, the goalposts should not be moved because one side has lost.
1/1	Cameron and Osborne lied. The ivory tower bureacracy of the EU is opposed to democracy. The road to hell is paved with unaccountable bureaucrats.
0/1	Cameron was not honourable in his departure, he was dishonourable in getting the UK to this position stoking the language that meant a Leave vote was a success.
0/-1	Campaigners for another EU referendum have gathered in Edinburgh to repeat calls to "stop the clock" on Brexit
1/1	Can I ask you a question that no politician, past and present remainer has answered, and that is what are the benefits of the EU for the working class. There are none, the aim is to make us poorer,and the rich , richer, it is happening.
1/1	Can anyone suggest even ONE sensibly honest and practical reason for Britain remaining under EU commission rule?
0/1	Can anyone tell me just how drunk Camo was when he decided to go for a referendum on EU membership?
0/0	Can some politician have an ‚ÄôEmperors new clothes‚Äô moment please and ask the government to justify this fiasco without reverting to ‚Äôwill of the people‚Äô. We have no withdrawal deal, no trade deal in sight, no arrangement on services, Scotland wants to leave the UK, there is no solution is sight for NI, Gibraltar will be open to Spanish claims. The government is making plans for food and medicine shortages, gridlock and riots. Teresa May, I challenge you to justify this mess.
0/0	Can stop blaming the evil EU and start blaming "Londoners"? Always great to find a new scapegoat.
1/1	Can these globalists shut up already? The people voted, at least pretend we still have democracy.
0/0/0	Can we just forget about BREXIT and act as if it never ever happened at all?
0/0	Can we just stop Brexit now? It was fun for a bit but now its just tedious..
1/1	Can we nuke Brussels yet?
1/1	Can we please just leave
0/0	Can we sue TM for taking us hostage on this undeliverable brexshit rollercoaster.
1/-1	Can you believe anything broadcast on the mainstream anymore, they will not accept the will of the British people
0/0	Can you imagine ANY other circumstances when a THIRD of UK businesses would be planning to move out of the country? This is on your head @theresa_may @Conservatives & unless you stop enabling Brexit, you too @jeremycorbyn
1/1	Can't believe some people still trying to "get around" the #Brexit.
1/0	Can't leave until the EU says so! ¬†Who in their right mind would sign up to a deal like this?
1/1	Can't wait for no deal brexit. Should have said to the EU two and half years ago, wto rules or free trade agreement.
1/1	Can't wait till 29 march when no deal Brexit happens!
1/1	Can't wait to be free of these bullies.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Can't wait to become weaker and poorer
1/1	Can't wait to leave the EU. Corrupt wankers.
1/1	Canada, a child of Britain, has more sovereignty then the United Kingdom. Canada refused to be absorbed by the union to their south. The UK just gave up.
0/0	Cancel Brexit
0/0	Cancel Brexit and the Tory party.
0/0	Cancel Brexit please.
0/0	Cancel brexit
0/0	Cancelling brexit is the best option.
0/0	Cannot believe it that people actually voted for an exit...
0/0	Cant believe the English were that stupid to vote to leave the EU
0/-1	Can‚Äôt believe that as a country we‚Äôd prefer to spend ¬£92m to *design* a shittier alternative to a project we were an integral part of rather than continue to co-operate with the French.
1/1	Can‚Äôt wait for Brexit! We need to take our country back! If only we‚Äôd never joined
0/0	Can‚Äôt wait for the financial crash after berxit. I‚Äôll be able to pick up a house dirt cheep
1/1	Careful madam Merkel might send you off too the work camps. No deal is the only valid option left, the main leaders of the EU have publicly said no way in hell can that deal be modified, if any of those leaders now change they minds, those leaders and their parties would lose all power in they home lands. Those leaders have backed themselves into a box they cant hope too get out of without losing, which has forced the UK In to a no deal, the only other option left too us is too stay and that would still force us too leave due too civil unrest like France is currently in the middle of. That's one lesson all UK MPs need too think of ATM.
0	Carry on with Brexit and earn your place as the woman who did not listen, destroying party, the UK and our futures.
0/-1	Certainly EU itself would radically change or possibly even fall apart if Britain leaves, meaning a whole new set of European order would emerge
1	Chance of a better trade relationships with other non-EU countries.
1/1	Chance to increase trade in emerging markets quicker than remaining in the EU bloc.
1/-1	Channel 4 is a EU puppet!....
1/-1	Charles de Gaulle was right you shouldn't join
0/0	Cheap #Brexit propaganda by using #Greece so stupid! #StrongerIn #StrongerInEurope #referendum #EUreferendum
1/1	Cheers from America! Britain for the Brits!!
0/0	Churchill believed in a United Europe.As a WW2veteran I know it would be a disaster if we left Europe.Let us work for a United States of Europe and ensure that future generations don't have to go through what me and my mates had to do.Dont listen to these Little England idiots
1/1	Churchill would not have surrendered. He did not surrender to the Germans in 1940, unlike the current Conservative Prime Minister. The UK should tell the EU how it is leaving, not ask. That is what Churchill would have done.
0/0	Clear stuff. The ONLY alleged opportunities if Brexit arise from the ability to sign independent trade deals. That means if Brexiters cannot prove they are able to fix BETTER trade deals, the UK should remain in the EU.
0/0	Clever name. That is all.
1/1	Clive Thomas, its the EU that will end up bankrupt without our handouts. If anyone cannot deal with life after Brexit then pack your bags and go live in one of the corrupt EU member states.
1/1	Closing their border would be a good idea if it would be 2 sided and happend earlier. Imigrants counldn't enter britain and also british people couldn't exit their land killing people and ruin every place in the world.
1/1	Come guys, vote to leave! I left my wife best decision ever!
1/1	Come in...but you gotta pay a shitload. No thanks. Bye
1/1	Come on brexit we want out got it out means out
1/1	Come on let's get out now no deal they need us more than we ever needed them.forty billion could do a lot for our United kingdom not Europe.
0/0	Come on, you has like 10% of the seats in the European Parliament, you have alot of power xD To make laws in European Union legislative procedure it requires at least 50%, so if you already have 10% you can make a big difference, just saying..
0/0	Coming from a northerner we will literally go into poverty. Wigan and all the other high unemployment areas in the UK are gonna look like Africa. Brexit was a mistake.
0/-1	Common wealth, fastest joke ever.
0/0	Commonwealth will soon be dominated again by one country but this time it will be India with over 50% of the population . The UK will be an outpost.
0/0	Compare UK pre- and post-‚Äô73, more rights, better food & coffee, cleaner environment, even more wonderful students. No brainer. #VoteRemain
1/1	Compared with the international market, the EU has caused people here to pay more for these things. Once the UK is out of Europe, people face cheap food prices, and they only have to pay the same price as anywhere else in the world. This is very good for us.
1/1	Complacency and comfort are our greatest enemies. Being a part of a failing EU bureaucracy would have keep us in such a state until it was to late to do anything about it.
1/1	Complete and utter tripe - our best chance is to get out now rather than sink even deeper into the mire. Revenge will come as we regenerate and the EU experiment implodes.
0/0	Completely agree I'm 17 and the large of my age group/generation  voted remain as you know
1/1	Completely baffling - 53% of voters want to see housing, NHS and Education disasters, an ever-expanding Brussels federal vampire squid, and a population in our tiny island soaring over the 100- million mark in the space of as little as 30 years. Are they MAD? As for a "LEAVE" economic collapse, it will take us twenty years to extricate ourselves from the sinking EU Titanic - unless it collapses beforehand - so why wouldn't the sun rise on Friday morning? REMAIN lobby beware - voting to stay only delays the day you will HAVE to vote LEAVE.
1/1	Completely democratic. Proud of my fellow remainers!
0/1	Concern is mounting that we‚Äôll leave without a deal. I‚Äôm more concerned that we leave with a bad deal.
0/0	Confederate States of America anyone? The South decided to leave (like Britain) and it hurt their economy (like it will Britain's). I personally believe this was a stupid idea, but I live in the US where we already figured this out before.
1/0	Congrats britbongs! You're finally free!
1/1	Congrats to Britain for taking back their country.
0/0	Congrats, i hope you all enjoy our economy going to shit, all major companies providing employment and investment leaving, our nations diverse culture imploding and our complete lack of presence in the international community. Just remember it was your narrow mind which brought it.
0/0	Congratulation to the ever-polite and patient Monsieur Barnier to point out ONCE AGAIN that the EU does not need us more than we need them. As for not paying the ¬£39 billion we owe, it will be a clear sign to all countries around the world that we are dishonest and incapable of honouring the terms of a contract. Nobody will want to sign a trade deal with us.
1/1	Congratulations Britain! You've made the right decision. Britain for Britain. No more will the EU tell Britain how to run their own country
1/1	Congratulations Britain.
1/1	Congratulations Briton and the British peoples.¬†Truly the Brits have shown great courage to divorce the oppressive so called Zionist EU.
1/0	Congratulations England and Wales, this is the beginning of a divided Britain. I think it's very likely that Scotland will become independent now, coming from a Scot who wanted to stay in Britain, but now wants to leave...
1/1	Congratulations british citizens! You left the IV Reich! Who lives will see...
1/1	Congratulations enough brains to leave that oppressive European Union
0/0	Congratulations everyone ..... now we look like total plonkers all over the world. Can't believe that people didn't check out the full implications instead of swallowing all those divisive lies - smoke and mirrors, and bigotry. I read and listened to so much stuff that it felt like my eyes and ears were bleeding. If we thought we were desperate before the referendum, just wait and see what's coming. I'm too old to emigrate to anywhere in the Commonwealth (there's an oxymoron for you) ... sheesh!!! I'd love a referendum on the royal family though ...... errrm, no scratch that, so many damn fools would vote to keep them because "She's a lovely old woman".
1/1	Congratulations for leaving the EU.
1/1	Congratulations from Canada! It will be great seeing England especially, and it's people rise again.
1/1	Congratulations on being a genuine example of courage and strength for the well being of all Great Britain citizens. Don‚Äôt stop.
1/1	Congratulations on your new found independence!
1/1	Congratulations to Britain for leaving the EU. Party is over europeans, time to go home
1/1	Congratulations to all British citizens who had the guts to slam the door on this crooked European Union! Just hope my country (and many more) to follow the same path.
0/0	Congratulations, Brexiteers, for doing your best to destroy UK as anything of consequence in the world.
0/0/0/0	Congratulations...you ruined your country....
1/1	Congratz for getting your country's independents back soon.
0/0	Conning people into thinking they were voting for ‚Äú freedom‚Äù or ‚Äútaking back control‚Äù and then handing over money to support idiot manipulators like Tommy Robinscum is just another form of slavery by the back door. More zero hr contracts, more exploitation by the ‚Äúelites‚Äù they fight against, which include Tommy Robinscum and Farage, who are coining it in on the back of Brexit
0/0	Considering that the people were told lies in order to vote for brexit, chances are that another referendum will end with a clear majority for staying.¬†If there is an honest campaign that properly informs the people on what to expect anyway.
0/0	Considering the UK economy will take some time to reconfigure from plugging the gaps by immigration Brexit is likely just to mean poorer people will come from further away for the first few years at least. Irony is fun!
1/1	Constantly trying to use misdirection by talking about business. We didn't vote on protecting rich business owners. We voted to leave the EU. LEAVE MEANS LEAVE! AND DOES NOT MEAN WITH A DEAL!
0/0	Conversation between two shop assistants in the men's clothing section of a department store, overheard today: "We've already started losing jobs, and #Brexit hasn't even started yet." The penny is dropping.
0/0	Correction : Brexit is a terrible deal. Regardless which one
1/1	Corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !!
0/0	Cosmopolitan London has no place in narrowminded, bigoted little England.
0/1	Countries like the UK, who are only in the EU to stop it from progressing, are better off leaving
1/1	Crash out , more doom and gloom , I thought the Sun was on the side of the majority of the British people and not the luvvies and big business that want cheap labour.
1/1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU.
1/1/1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU. Did the EU give you a grant for your video? It's biased in many areas! The UK is being punished by the EU for the democratic decision of it's people.
0/0	DESTROY BREXIT THIS WEEK.
0/-1	Daily Mail backs Brexit in EU referendum
1/1/1	Damn it, the Brexit was the right thing to do, the EU is a sinking ship, get out before it drowns your country! Greetings from Germany.
0/0	Damn it..there's NO COMPROMISE #BREXIT is INVALID. It's based on LIES. ILLEGALITIES & PARTY POLITICAL INTEREST
0/0	Damn the brits rly did not think things thru before they voted. Or they were poorly informed
0/0	Danger of democracy - the uninformed voting for people as uninformed as themselves - leads to chaos,confusion, and little progress to a better life, individually or nationally.
1/0	Dangerous times ahead.People are being asked to vote on a subject that the great British public knows so little about.
1/0	Dark and undemocratic forces have been at work for over two years trying to stop Brexit. They are still hard at it, but running out of time.  My message to the sneering Metropolitan liberal elite is to turn over a new leaf in 2019, accept that democracy is better than autocracy and that the electorate knows better than you do.
1/0	David Cameron must be excluded from front bench politics ever again. He deserted his post, and is as much a snake as Tony BLiar. NO! Never again.   The EU is not a club!!!! It's a political Union, I don't want to live in a state in a country called Europa.
0/0/-1	David Cameron, a political adventurer with first class education and a second class brain. He'll be remembered for the Brexit fiasco, the Panama papers and the endless austerity measures.
1/1	Day UK leaves the EU will be great as you get rid of the madness little by little
1/0	Day one after brexit... Nothing changes... It will be a slow change as laws and regulations are changed, ratified or modified on both sides.
1/1	Dead dead dead, Democracy is dead. Stand up for democracy and deny the remainers and some others guilty of stealing democracy, and ignoring the True Informed Peoples Vote of 2016.
1/1	Dead right who cares what the EU want, lets just leave and keep the money promised
1/1	Deal? - what deal? there is no deal.....just a load of rubbish thanks to May. She must go. We didnt vote to leave only if there were a "deal", we voted to leave....period
0/0	Dear "left behind" brexiters, it seems the Conservative *do* have money for your communities, they just didn't want to give it to you. I guess you'll blame the EU for this as well?
1/1	Dear Channel 4 not a SINGLE leave voter will vote remain. I will put ¬£1000 of my own money on a bet that if there were a second referendum the LEAVE vote will be MUCH higher. We've seen nothing but a political class spectacularly fail on leaving the first time and now our wills are like iron. You failed to do it properly the first time and we will absolutely WRECK you if a second referendum comes.
0/1	Dear John, We‚Äôre concerned about the lack of Brexit full stop. And the Parliamentary time, and taxpayers‚Äô money, being wasted on a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô that no-one outside Parliament actually wants. Make the most of the last few months of the old system. A new one is coming.
0/0	Dear friends, if you choose to leave the EU, you will destroy your economy. You think you can leave EUs trading bloc and puff, you'll negotiate a deal and it will be just like before, only this time you'll be free... Frankly that's bs. Not only will it take years to establish new trading agreements with the EU and with third party counties(since Britain was relying on EUs already established trading agreements with these third party countries)
0/0	Dear oh dear Brexit; what a complete and utter mess! And sadly this was all totally predictable after 23 June 2016. It was bound to happen when stupid people voted leave primarily to stop immigration to the UK (which Brexit WON‚ÄôT do by the way!) without considering the financial social and economic consequences of their actions. What Brexiteers did in effect was to sign a blank contract the details of which are now being filled in by the EU. What kind of idiot would do that??
0/0	Dear oh dear, Brexit; what a complete and utter mess!
1/1	Death to the European imperialists!
1	Decision was made , Act on it no more excuses!
0/0	Declining, declining, declining. Becoming irrelevant in the world to be ruled by world's past powers, China, India, etc.
0	Deeming us racist because we opted out
0/0	Delaying Brexit for a few weeks or months is neither here nor there. The damage being done to this country - its economy, global reputation and social harmony - will take a generation to heal.
1/-1	Democracy delayed is democracy denied.
0/0	Democracy doesn't mean throwing yourself and your country down the toilet and pulling the chain. That's what Brexit is.
0/1	Democracy has been denied...
1/-1	Democracy has me all confused. People vote on issues and the one that gets the most votes is enacted - right? So what is all this nonsense about a second vote? The Tories won the election we don‚Äôt like that result let‚Äôs have another election? That‚Äôs not how democracy works. Remainers you lost get over it and get on board with the brexiteers.
1/1	Democracy in Europe has been hijacked by a  group of politicians who have  taken away accountability and brought in their own system of control. What happened to Greece was a foreboding , punished for daring to challenge the EU dictatorship.
0/0	Democracy in hands of irresponsible unneducated citizens is one of a big nonsense.
1/1	Democracy in the U.K. will never be the same again. Just deselect the MPs who are not following the wishes of their constituents.
1/1	Democracy will only be served when we're out of the EU with a No Deal. We did not ask for a deal, it's the EU's job to offer a deal and ours to accept what we feel is a deal. That's where May got it wrong in the first place.
0/0	Democracy's biggest fail. I hope they don't regret it
0/0	Denialism is the new mantra, Brexiters thought they would leave with better conditions than actual members of the EU and other countries would follow, well events have proved otherwise.
1/-1	Deselect the lot of them that cause trouble
0/0	Despite the Euroskeptics fear mongering and using false stats all the time. Never mind all the assumptions and poorly research 'migrant stats' that they love to reel off (fyi they are usually wrong).
1/1	Despite the scares nothing much will change if we leave the EU. Except we will be free and independent.
0/0	Destroy Britain's economy, leave the EU
1/1	Did you catch that......... Mr Rees-Mogg said he is willing to pay for it... Well I'm not, I would not give the EU a penny, they are keeping ¬£billions of pounds of assets which we paid for, there is no reason to bail them out further.
1/1	Did you vote to renegotiate our terms? I didn't.
1/1	Didn't vote for it but I'm up for Brexit deal/no deal PROVIDING there's lots of useful criticism of it from the Lords or anyone.
0/0	Direct democracy doesn't work. It's like asking an english teacher how to repair a broken motor.
0/0	Disaster. I'm ashamed of my home country and will seek Scottish citizenship now that their independence is practically guaranteed.
1/1	Disgusted with Mogg putting his party before the country. It is law if we don't get a deal we leave with no deal has he said himself. So why all this rubbish about a 2nd referendum something stinks.
1/1	Do liberals not understand that people can see through their magic, disappearing illegal in the phrase illegal immigrants? That's why Brexit won. Stop thinking you've a monopoly on being right. Some people value sovereignty over prices being a bit lower.
0/0	Do not play chicken with the EU.
0/0	Do the british people really think that not being in the EU can stop the migrants
0/0	Do the people who are happy to exit on WTO terms realise we would have the same access to the world markets as countries such as South Sudan
1/1	Do the remainers not understand the end goal of the EU? Well I spell it out for them. It means the end of nations and all the diversity and freedom that brings.
1/1	Do these anti brexiteers have any idea of the consequences of their actions? Possibly out of a job at the next election - or national unrest.
0/0	Do us proud Britain; vote for cooperation, friendship & safety. Reject hate & xenophobia. Please. #StrongerIn
0/1	Do we create a Better Britain in a Better Europe for a Better World?
1/1	Do we hell as like you morons. We had the vote, we‚Äôve had the result now deliver what the country voted for and get on with it.
1/1	Do we know what to expect if we are kept in the EU? Continuous industries loss, job losses and ties into treaty of lisbon!
0/0	Do you honestly think Brussels will give the UK a good trade deal post-Brexit? We'd be very lucky if we got anything at all. Of course Germany and France would want to insist on a reasonable one for their benefit, but how much of a "good" trade deal is uncertain. Also, Germany and France are the UK's largest trade partners after the USA, why risk jeopardizing this in a movement that is likely to stir political resentment?
1/1	Do you remember when we were promised that the UK would leave the Customs Union in March 2019? We should, because the Prime Minister stated so 23 times in the House of Commons alone.
0/0	Do you want to be left alone in an island with these politicians?
1/1	Does the name Anna Lindh mean anything? In 2003 Sweden went to the polls in a referendum on the euro the pro side were way out in front until the murder of this women. Goes to show the damage it can do I bet Cameron rubbed his hands in delight.....vote leave people
1/1	Does your house have a front door? Why? Could it be you want to control who comes and goes? The presence of the door doesn't stop you from talking to your neighbor, working with them on projects, exchanging a few beers etc, but at the end of the day, it's your house, no one else's.  Do you let your neighbour tell you when the door should be open?
1/1	Doesn't address the fact that the EU is a already a sinking boat. Better to jump ship now while you still can.
1/1	Doesnt matter how you look at it,a no deal scenario is the best deal by far. Only then can we square up to the EU with a very good case for a free trade deal that is at least fair to the UK.
0/0	Doire Finn attended the demonstration yesterday to give a clear message - Brexit will not be put in the way of our fragile peace process & a hard border will not be tolerated by any community in Northern Ireland. This is our future stability at risk!!
1/1	Don't be a fooled by terms like : " EU Money, EU Grants, EU Loans and EU Funding" it was our money to begin with
1/1	Don't blame brexit for this crap. This is just the EU being dicks and trying so hard to make it look like it's brexit...it's not.
0/0	Don't buy her lies as the only Brexit (as shown by government analysis)... the national interest is no Brexit!
0/0	Don't call the UK a democracy if it allows any Brexit to happen.
1/1	Don't care the price for freedom
0/0	Don't care what they call it, just as long as we stay in the EU. Maybe we can then get revenge on the Tory lies and two faced talk.
1/1	Don't face up to democratic outcomes , wether you vote to remain or leave, you go by the majority, I've never voted cons but you go with the majority and we get what we deserve, it's called living in a democracy

1/1	Don't let remain convince you that they own all the smart people, they don't.
1/1	Don't let them delay the 29 March exit, it's all kabuki theater to delay delay delay then cancel Brexit.
1/1	Don't negotiate. We don't want you to negotiate. Just shut up and go away.
1/1	Don't try and turn around Brexit. Deliver on what we voted for
1/1	Don't walk away! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. There is nothing the E.U can do about it except beg . Don't give them two fingers,they are not worth one.Stand up straight for once in your life and leave E.U. NOW.Gain some pride Theresa May,they have been and still are taking the piss out of you and Parliament
1/1	Don't want to be in a fully federal EU. Want to be an independent UK.
1/1	Don't worry Herr Juncker the British people are all aware you and your unelected cohorts will make life difficult for the UK to 'teach the other 27'. There are plenty of developing Nations that will be glad to trade with the British we all look forward to paying less for our goods in the near future.
1/0	Don't worry UK, you will have your "freedom" while your economy collapses. The poor people who voted for Brexit to learn a harsh lesson.
1/-1	Don't worry about such terrible things, our generous Frau Merkel will take care of all the British refugees.
0/0	Don't worry about the health and well being of this country you might say?  As long as we get our BREXIT? bloody fools!
1/1	Don't worry. Don't worry. We aint all stupid. We will Vote OUT.
0/0	Don't you realise that if brexit happens there won't even be a UK. Scotland will demand independence as the majority voted remain. We'll be half an island off the coast of a massively successful trading block!
0/0	Dont be fooled by Leavers saying Remain have it in the bag! Please make sure you vote! Vote Remain #VoteRemain Its common sense #StrongerIn
1/1	Dont be scared people of the UK. We will be stronger outside of the EU and we can use the ¬£350 million we give the EU to improve education for the next generations and improve the NHS for everyone including our elderly relatives and children who are most in need.
1/1	Dont call yourself a democracy if you cannot handle the outcome of an election
0/0	Dont waste your breath on a brexiter
1/1	Dont we all wish Brexit would just happen already
1/1	Don¬øt be like Greece which voted to stay in and have been taken over and pushed into the ground. Take this one opportunity to escape domination by the EU secretive power elite, and taste the sweetness of freedom and opportunity, leave austerity behind, get up off our knees and take back our initiative, enterprise, inspiration, and success around the world. Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for. Fortune favours the brave. Tim Peake did it in space, we can do it on Earth. Take courage and do it for all our futures. VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Don‚Äôt hold your breath as you‚Äôll be dead by the time anything happens. Jeremy Corbyn has historically always been against the European Union.He‚Äôs also unfortunately been my MP for over 30 years although as a Green Party member I have Never Voted for him or his archaic unrepresentative politics.

0/0	Drop Brexit is a another, perfectly good option too!
0/0	Drop a like on my comment if you are like me and think Britain should have remain
1/-1	Drunk and corrupt Juncker is giving EU no value. Human rights should be put up in the list above all particular poitical interests. It‚Äôs all about money.
1/1	Dude, did the thought cross your mind that maybe the Brits actually just got tired of having laws imposed on them by people in Brussels they didn't even elect and just wanted their sovereignity oder borders, legislation etc. back?
0/0	Dumb move by the UK.
0/1	Dumb move, being made dumber by how they're going about it. Barring a major turnaround in negotiations, it's going to be disastrous for them.

1/1	EU has already started collapsing. Britians exit was a long term strategy.
1/-1	EU have no power to kidnap Uk
1/1	EU hypocrisy and myopia, united in supporting of the Irish backstop so the UK leaves without a deal and no backstop.

1/1/1	EU is a scam
0/0	EU is basically a large welfare state....
0/0	EU is changing all the time. And inside the EU the UK can, and has changed in the past. So what the UK could do is stay in the EU, argue for what it wants, win some, lose some as in the past.
1/1	EU is controlled by multinational companies and their lobbyists influencing national politicians.

1/1	EU is falling apart. Thanks God we are leaving..
0/0	EU is not there to govern its members and has never done so. There are rules and regulations agreed and voted by all representatives of the member states. The stupidity and EU hatred fed by the right wing press in uk is mind boggling. Incredible.
1/1	EU is talking about border when they dont want any borders and allow mass influx of illegal immigrants. The sooner the UK leaves this corrupt club the better.
1/1	EU is terrified of losing the budget that the UK provides
0/0	EU is the worlds best alliance of western democracies and the best model ever invented for peaceful cooperation between countries in Europe and a better future for our great continent. Never before have people in Europe had such opportunities to influence Europe's development and future. Civil servants from all member states including UK meet every single day and work together to find solutions on issues of shared interest. Truly a people's participation project and genuine democracy. I am so thankful that my own children will remain part of the EU family and I truly wish UK would review rethink and remain. üå∏
1/1	EU is tired and sick of paying Greeks debt. Next one is GrExit?
1/1	EU is unreformable, EU is profligate, EU is undemocratic EU is over bureaucratic EU is divisive EU is not for us
1/1	EU is very sneaky and stops UK from fishing, farming, trading and law making on its own. Plus the rest. If the USA was being told by another country what it could or couldnt do, how would that feel to the people who live and work there?
1/1	EU isn't a good idea at any point.
0/0	EU isn't as bad as some people would like to believe. I admit, there were some mistakes that weren't handled well, migration crisis that went out of control, article 13 and other things. But it still is the best project that we've ever had as a whole Europe, for never before in the history of mankind have so many states united under one flag. EU is a child in its infancy, it makes mistakes, of course. But you do not kill a child because of a mistake. You teach from it, you adjust it and make it better.
0/0	EU isn't as bad as some people would like to believe. I admit, there were some mistakes that weren't handled well: migration crisis that went out of control, article 13 and other things. But it still is the best project that we've ever had as a whole Europe
1/1	EU just a signed deal with Japanesse. 50% biger than UK. EU will be just fine. Leave, we need move on. You can argue after, how long you fancy.

1/1	EU look like Republic in the Star Wars movie
1/1	EU membership involves giving up some control over domestic affairs
1/0	EU mercifully invites war refugees to their lands, and in return these people repay their kindness with violence and mayhem. Most of the "refugees" appear to be war age single men. This entire situation is just unreal and it's almost tragic that people would dare call anyone who is not ok with this kind of behavior a "racist." What a lazy state of mind.

0/0	EU regulations protect many basic labour and safety rights that would otherwise not exist. Unless the plan is to exploit more freely.
1/1	EU rules from the Commission, Pro EU unions and their Anti-British sentiments, help make this happen, that's why we must get Brexit even with a no-deal, then we can outlaw these cave dwelling union fat cats and start to rule ourselves.
1/1	EU saw what we could achieve together and they saw what happened when one nation thought they could set themselves above everyone else (and also they were pretty worried).
0/1	EU seems like they have got tired of out child like politics. Maybe we should of had a clear plan of leaving to show the voters before the vote. I am all up for a gamble at a blind auction, but its my money I could waste, not others.

1/1/1	Economics aside, brexit is a triumph for democracy in Britain
0/0	Economists are unanimous, and have been for hundreds of years, that free trade produces wealth, and tariffs and other barriers make everybody poorer. So if Britain leaves, tariffs will go up between Britain and the continent and Britain will be poorer. This is the main critique of Brexit.
1/1	Educate yourself about the EU..you may surprise yourself?....the EU is evil!
0/0	Effects of Brexit struck home with reality today for our family. Brother in law, a hard working and productive professional got laid off. Uncertainty leaves bosses no choice but to cut back on costs so as to survive pending downturn caused by Brexit.

1/1	Europe is already united no war is going to happen and every European doesn't hold any real problems with other Europeans its just that the EU was the worst possible way to unite Europe I mean the EU tried to get rid of nationalism in Europe, Europe the second most patriotic place next to he US.
1/1	Europe is becoming a "United states of Europe" and Britain is far better than some state controlled by a federal government our ancestors would be rolling in their graves
1/1	Europe is crumbling all countries must leave the EU before it's to late.
1/1	Europe is infected with cancer and its time for us to make the hard choice and make our Country Great Again
0/1	Europe is that member of the family that only comes around at Christmas and acts like everything is ok. The United Kingdom is the family member who wishes to get everything ironed out.
0/1	Europe is weak, they rely on the backs of Britain and the US for military safety
1/1	Europe never wanted us, only our money.
0/1	Europe should push away England and welcome others which want to stay !
1/0	Europe shouldn't forget that we have the British and Americans to thank for destabilizing the Middle East by attacking Irak, leading to the countless deaths go millions of people and the Refugee Crisis very few of whom found their way to the UK !The reason that people in the UK are suffering is because of an incompetent Administrative System , Greedy useless Politicians and a disillusioned electorate.
1/1	Europe will still be united, but each country won't be completely dependent on the others.  A nation must be able to act alone (within reason), and stand alone.
0/0	European Britain had an amazing French Fan of London Bridge. He painted it more than 40 times. He never thought of Britons not being part of a European nation. You can see 3 examples and there is an amazing European exhibition in Worcester Museum

1/1	European Union is an utter mess, glad we are leaving. No one wants to be ruled by Merkel
1/1	European Union is as corrupted as the fifa
0/1	European farmers are rightly wondering how will they fare after the UK leaves the EU. All we hear from BBC et al is that the impact would be empty shelves and more expensive food in the UK - rarely a mention of the other side of the coin.

0/1	European union. It is now painfully obvious that this is not a goal that the UK as a society and culture is prepared to embrace
0/-1	Europeans' second language will normally ge English. That, in a nutshell, is a key driver of why the UK gets so many EU and non EU migrants
0/0	Europe‚Äôs links to America would become more tenuous. Above all, the loss of its biggest military power and most significant foreign-policy actor would seriously weaken the EU in the world.

1/1	Even if it brings war back in northern Ireland, time to put country above profit for once
1/1	Even remainders can see now there is no negotiating with the communist block. Not now, 2 years time or 1000 years time. Get out now
0/0	Even though I disagree with it, might as well get the best deal.
1/1	Even though its costing a lot, I think its the best way to go for UK and I like it.
0/0	Even with a deal, UK growth will be behind that of the EU.
0/0	Ever noticed how it‚Äôs only wealthy ppl saying it doesn‚Äôt matter if Brexit makes the rest of us poorer?
0/0	Every UK citizen is poorer today. Because of brexit.
0/1	Every analysis I've ever seen on Brexit ignores a basic fact, which should be obvious to anyone within a day of visiting the UK. British people, before any rational argument about society and the economy, have a primal hatred for Europe (meaning continental Europe). This has been ingrained into society through centuries of having one continental power or the other be England's main rival. First the Spaniards, then the Dutch, then the French, then the Germans. There are generations alive today, who watched the UK fight Germany, win the war at the cost of their entire empire, and then watched Germany rise again and take over. The amount of resentment against German dominance in the EU cannot be understated.  When you understand the above, you can begin to understand Brexit. You can understand why, after the vote, the greatest celebration wasn't for democracy or the economy, but for the fact that the EU would be unraveled. First and foremost, people who voted for Leave wanted to write the next chapter in their fight with Europe. You can now also begin to understand where the confirmation bias comes from, which enables them to believe that small advantages from Brexit will compensate for undoing the UK's biggest competitive advantage in the world economy.
1/1	Every country who joins the EU must handover their economic, soverign, social, judicial & democratic rights to an elitist, self serving corrupt federation run by Merkler!!
0/0	Every day Brexit reaches new levels of madness.
0/0/0	Every day I get angrier and angrier with Brexit enablers.
0/0	Every day that goes by Slowly remain seems to be the most sensible and obvious thing to do. Every day we are getting stronger and stronger in proving not on what we are saying but what reality is on the current world stage.
0/0	Every day. And every time they try and justify it further, it makes me angrier. This is the single biggest fuck up by the government in my lifetime, will affect the entire country for generations and has zero possibility of anything positive coming from it. All we had to do, was remain. How can a government fuck up so badly and with so little regard for the consequences, even when they're staring you in the face?
0/0	Every industry is going to be affected. Its insane how much is going to change that hadn't already been sorted.
0/0	Every intelligent UK Citizen now is aware that BREXIT is a total disaster.
0/0	Every last one of these cunts should be tried for treason
1/1	Every layer of "authority" over me and the one life I get is unwelcome. Brexit removes one layer.
1/1	Every negative commentator on Brexit (ie Remoaners who are dismissive of democracy) assume that damaging tariffs will be imposed on the UK.
1/1	Every negative commentator on Brexit (ie Remoaners who are dismissive of democracy) assume that damaging tariffs will be imposed on the UK. Why is that ? Why can we not set our tariffs to 0% and expect reciprocity from the EU ?
1/1	Every one needs to speak about what will happen if we stay in, the Lisbon 2022 treaty will see us lose the pound, Gibraltar and the Falklands, the stock exchange which will lose 200,000 jobs? What the hell are they trying to stay in for.
1/1	Every power the EU has is a power confiscated from you. #brexit
1/1	Every single Policy dreamed up by Adonis and implemented by Blair have been complete failures, even Adonis admits this and yet here we are having to listen to this dome headed failure lecture everyone on staying in the EU.
0/0	Every single person that I've talked to who supports the leave side has NO idea how the EU works or what it does for us. This vote showed the world just how stupid and gullible the British public can be - and here I thought we were better than the Americans.
0/0	Every time I feel like giving up and saying ‚Äúlet them have their god awful Brexit‚Äù, some new hell or suffering emerges!
1/1	Every time I tell someone I voted out:  There's at first a look of denial  Then shock and disbelief  Proceeded by a sceptical attempt to understand why  Followed by some dooms day comments about the UK  And then acceptance that the issue is not straight forward  Most people didn't even know how the EU functioned politically when they voted, and still don't even know how it works now. I decided to look into it, and it's why, with a very, very heavy heart, I voted out.  So, what exactly is the EU?  As you know, it started off as mostly a free trade arrangement in order to promote peace (through economical interdependence). The UK opted in later, during the thatcher era! As time went on, it developed into a political union. Whilst not technically a federal union, it's pretty much heading in that direction. I'm not actually against that idea, I would like to see a fully democratic union. UEU or Europada? We could have a living wage across the EU which would solve many of the problems.  So, what are the political structures and how do they work?  There are three main ones with power: the Council, the Parliament, and the Commission.  Council ("legislative body"): As I understand it, ministers from each country meet and can approve or veto legislation passed to them. For example, when trying to mandate free health care EU wide, all 28 (well 27 now) health care ministers would meet to approve laws). = something vaguely akin to senators in the US system.  Parliament ("legislative body"): Every country elects representatives, the share of which depends on, of all things, treaties with your country. Like the council, this body approves/vetos legislation only. If they do not respond within enough time, the Council may bypass this body. = something vaguely akin to the house of Representatives in the US system.  Commission ("executive body"): This is my favourite part of the EU (not!). This body is made up of 28 (now 27) appointed people, one for each country. How they are removed is not clear to me, if they even get removed at all. It's meant to be the EXECUTIVE body - think obama - but it is kind enough to handle creating all the legislation, trade deals and war/humanitarian decisions. At least it still needs to get legislation passed by the Council and maybe Parliament... which turns out not to be too hard when all your friends sit on the Council and the largest majority of representatives in the Parliament are, by treaty, German, French, Italy and Spain (Although the UK had a large chunk too to be fair). So yeah, our executive body seems to do, well, everything! And it's not even elected!  The president of the Commission, who may as well be the president of the EU, is appointed by the 28 countries' leaders. (S)he has to negotiate with the country leaders for the appointed commissioners, but can assign them to whatever political roles s(he) desires. (S)he must be able to speak French (or France will shit a brick making life difficult for Germany). That limits our choice of president to France, Belgium or other vaguely French speaking countries in that area.  What about the events happening in the news within the EU?  A. Meanwhile, the situation in Greece is certainly frown worthy. Sure, the Greek government, and thus the people, mismanaged their finances. But to demand they make themselves so poor that young people end up sitting around jobless in their millions... I mean, do we really hate Greek people this much? There must be a better way. Greece cannot obviously devalue the euro to encourage tourism to help itself out of debt. We could subsidize it instead to make holidays artificially cheap there until their economy recovers, but the EU just won't go for that. Cos punishment is better I guess.  B. Canada didn't originally want to allow Romanians and Bulgarians visa free access. Since the UK needs the EU to conduct trade deals with Canada, and trade deals must be approved unanimously by all 28 countries AND that neither Romania nor Bulgaria will agree unless Canada grants them visa free access - the UK was unable to ever establish a free trade deal. I think Canada recently agreed and will now allow the visa free travel. Thus, something that has nothing to do with trade had become a show stopper for everyone else, even countries outside the EU.  C. Countries like Germany, France and even the UK enjoy cheap labour from the EU east for jobs that locals won't do for what is basically a nonsense wage for living in that western country. As things are much cheaper in the east, Eastern Europeans can easily send a small slice back to their families and it will mean a lot. I'm not against that in itself, but what I object to is that it hurts the local lower class workers in these western countries because if you live here and you're poor - who wants to work for minimum wage just to scrape by? Is it really that hard to understand why those we look down on as the thick, uneducated and lazy Brexiters are so angry by the situation? They themselves don't even understand the cycle that has been set up, but they just see that jobs they typically held have been replaced with immigrants. And hence it gives rise to xenophobia.  D. Related to the last point, many Eastern Europeans, in return, enjoy the generous welfare benefits from these countries, able to send money back to their families even though they're not living in the UK and live in a country that has vastly different living costs. The problem here is that yet more money is pouring out of the country away from the UK rather unnecessarily. How is this a good thing for Britain?  E. The EU has done a piss poor job of handling the refugee situation. Germany basically lead the EU into opening the flood gates without even consulting other countries. Many of the refugees are coming in from dire conditions to go onto waiting lists years long, as countries like Greece are already over burdened with debt. A proportion of the refugees are really just economic migrants from elsewhere than Syria - but the silly EU is doing nothing to filter them out, so they are contributing to the problem of the waiting lists and social resources etc, at the expense of genuine Syrians, and creating resentment of refugees.  F. As for immigration, why has it worked so well in Canada and so badly elsewhere? Simple: If you don't have a decent education and clean criminal record, you aren't getting in to Canada! There's no immediate access to benefits (so you have to really want to move there for a better life) and if you commit a crime, you'll never get permanent residence or citizenship. This is how a nation of so much cultural diversity manages to exist in such a harmonious state. I'd love to see something like this in Europe, although we do need to clean our own house first, as it seems a good chunk of the EU is as thick as two short planks. How do I support such an idea in the EU? I have no democratic voice. And with a few unelected officials deciding to allow basically anyone in, on the basis that even mentioning the idea of a system like Canada's would amount to racism (a phenomena known as the "regressive left"), what choice do I have? My mother can no longer go out to her local shop 350m away from her house after 7pm because gangs of foreigners from somewhere in the EU patrol and mug people who go near. One can see incidences of mass rape in Sweden and Germany and yet the police do nothing out of fear of being seen as racists. You don't hear incidences like this in Canada.  Fin  I find what a lot of these leave supporters are doing to the large amount of good foreigners in the UK an absolute disgrace! It's disgusting. I have at least three friends living in London who are from the EU, I'd hate to think someone would abuse them the way I've seen abuse lately. It was also why I had such a tough time voting. I'm pretty much voting against their interests, my families interests, my country's short term economical interests...  I studied the issue for probably 12 hours total, even on the day I wasn't sure, and I'm still not. But can you imagine the bottom of the unelected EU boot stamping on the face of the UK forever and ever? I'm just not sure it's something I can say yes to. The UK is gonna suffer a lot for a while. But I hope in the end the social, democratic and other problems get sorted. It's a risk I think is worth taking.  Edit: Italics show where I edited to correct wrong information (currently: how the commissioners and president are appointed)  Just to add: my main reason for voting out is solely the lack of democracy within the EU and the unwillingness to discuss things like free movement and immigration among the EU politicians. The only reason I critise immigration as it works in the EU currently is that as someone who now lives in Canada, I believe Canada has a better system of stricter immigration that has lead to a better society.
1/1	Every time Junkers and Tusk open their mouths it reaffirms the main reason I voted to leave
1/0/0	Everybody hates the EU, but the truth is we havent had a war between western european countries since second world war, that for me is the greatest achievement of the EU. Uk people think their lives are gonna improve with brexit, it's false, the conservatives only want to have more power to undermine the social state policies, and to launch UK in caothic neo-liberal rule, something that can't yet do under EU supervision( EU also wants to do the same but it's more difficult to do reforms with such a diverse variety of players, I mean the many different countries and political spectrum). If you think the EU is corrupt you should get interested and reform it from the inside so it benefits the common good. Just an opinion
1/1	Everyday they care less and less about the world seeing the motives behind the eu. It's all about milking the cash cow.
1/1	Everyone I know is voting leave. Nobody in England likes David Cameron because he hates the poor and is a criminal. If there are more votes for 'stay' then I'm going to believe it's been rigged. Nobody I know wants David Cameron anywhere near power.
1/1	Everyone in Ireland needs to know what @simoncoveney is planning with this #Ireland2040 crap. Planning to import a million people from Africa. And don't be fooled into thinking it's out of compassion. It's for profit. #Irexit should follow #brexit
1/1/1/1/1	Everyone knows that the EU is weak and is going to implode on itself very soon, it's better that we leave now than later.
0/0	Everyone looks on Britain, which was the country of a stable Parliament, with sheer horror and boredom
1	Everyone needs to look at 1972 pre single market, Britain had it's freedom was a major player in world trade and was at peace with the rest of Europe, travel the same as anywhere in the world, then we joined the single market, 1st thing food prices went through the roof, then we was rewarded with a luxury tax VAT, then bent banana's were banned, had to convert to metric....the list is never ending
1/1	Everyone seems to miss the point of brexit: the EU does not resemble a democracy and people want to change this.
1	Everyone that is against Brexit, should be moving.
0/0	Everyone who is a Leaver and is well off, claims to have done it for sovereignty. Everyone who is poor has claimed immigration as the main issue. Well- off people who are prepared to take a hit in personal finance do it so the majority, the other, live a better life. People who are poor and know that poor people will take the greatest hit, dont do it so others have a better life. They want others to have the same shitty life they have.
1/0	Everyone who thinks remaining in the EU is good for UK citizens should google "UK companies that has relocated using EU funding"

1/1	Everything is caused by the Globalist including all wars for control everything is controlled. even news media that spread half truths and lies but people listen to all the rubbish that is sold to us every day..people must wake up open their eyes and see the real truth. the plan is to weaken each economy cause many problems then they take control of all countries through the corrupt EU Control system were they rule with their laws above all of us...
1/1	Everything we import why dont we try to make and export to the rest of the world, if we have to rely on other countries to function this country has been failing for years
1/1	Everything you write just vindicates our vote to leave. I hope we see a huge surge in anti eu populist parties in the coming european elections. Brexit is going to happen one way or another. The eu's approach of showing complete and utter contempt for its members and thinking it can just bully them into doing what it wants just shows why it has no future.
1/1	Exactly - LEAVE should mean leave but we have a woman in charge who wanted to stay. It was staged from the beginning. Why do you think May was put in as PM in the first place. We do not count. She may state we are out (but doing deals with them, does not mean out in my opinion) and all the while she is pandering to Junker and his cronies and supporting remainers as well...... she is trying to make it look like she is supporting leave but she is trying to please everyone. The referendum was a 'farce' and waste of taxpayers money.
0/0	Exactly how I've felt every day since the referendum. My rights & opportunities & those of my kids are being torn away against our will. Am devastated at stupidity & arrogance of all those involved, & growing to hate my own country
0/0	Exactly the same reasons here. More money for public services and NHS? Yes! All of the campaign telling us they had plans for a smooth transition swayed me from voting stay and voting leave so the money could be better spent. Lies. All lies.
0/0	Exactly. Brexit has never stopped being the wrong decision. Just because MP‚Äôs are insisting on it doesn‚Äôt make it right, or mean that we have to endure it.
0/0	Excellent and true. Fuck farage... and trump by the way! Kind of good friends‚Äô package, mmhh?
1/1	Excellent result. Loving all the leftist tears.
1/1	Except now we have total and exclusive control over our political system. If people do truly want their rights they will vote for a party that will protect them. If not then they don't deserve them, simple.

1/0	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election
1/1	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election. This means that they obviously do not regret their vote to leave in 2016. And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists. So sad.
0/0	FFS, if a country's currency devalues by 20% how can that be good for the economy? It shows a complete lack of faith by other countries in what you are doing. No plan, no direction, total chaos for something that will provide nothing that Britain did not already have. Britain will lose a lot, but will gain nothing. Idiocy. History will not be kind.

1/1	FUCK YOU EUROPEAN UNION i did it for article 13
0/0	Faced with a choice between simple and naive myths and complex and ambiguous reality, the choice for most people is easy.
0/0	Fact is Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist
0/0	Fact is Norway is not part of the EU and still they can't control the mass influx of immigrants. Same as Switzerland, destiny of many economic immigrants from Syria, etc.
1/1	Fact- Great Britain always wins in the end. Yes that's a universal fact.
0/0	Fact: People who say "leave means leave" with no further reasoning have no interest in preserving the UK, only destroying the current one.
1/1	Far too late to have grown a spine, should have been hard right up front. The EU will collapse soon enough, its piled up.on far too much debt and overseas buyers for their goods are drying up.
0/0	Farage is a prick and so is everybody else who voted BREXIT
0/0	Farage lead the UK out of the European Union - and after he won the Brexit vote, he immediately fled like the COWARD he is.
0/0	Farage the snake making a fortune from all this. Remember that he caused it too
1/1	Farmers and Universities need to understand that even after they receive their money from the EU - the UK pays more on top - so in reality its just the UK's own money being recycled with a fee taken out - why ? Its just a big scam that costs the UK billions every year - No Deal thank you
1/1	Farrage always makes reasonable sense .. He has great ideas for leaving the E U and thats why Teresa May doesn‚Äôt like him !. Put Nigel Farrage in charge of BREXIT and it will happen !. Which is exactly what Teresa May is fighting against !.

0/0	Fear  divide and rule. The whole country from bottom to top is antique.

0/0	Feel like doing one on Scotland? Looks like an interesting political situation is about to unfold, Scotland voted strongly to remain in EU and are now exploring ways of staying in - potentially splitting from UK.
0/0/-1	Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide.
0/0	Feeling that Brexit and leaving the Customs Union is a tax hike, and the government is not interested in making free trade deals with anyone. Tax is wealthy including those who own the press instead.
1/1	Fellow Labour members. QUESTION: What is more important? The decision of a few thousand members at the last Labour Conference to keep a second referendum option. Or the promise we in Labour made to the British people to leave the EU who in their millions voted for us?

0/1	Financially the UK would be better off outside the EU
0/0	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid.
0/0	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid.  Britain makes up about 5% of the EU's trade GDP. The EU makes up about half of Britain's trade GDP. So they must have unrestricted access to the European Economic Area or they're kind of screwed (i.e., suddenly have tariffs imposed on half their trade)  Problem is, you still have to pay to access it if you leave so you don't have to pay EU membership fees. Other countries pay a huge chunk for this; equivalent to half or more of Britain's per-capita EU membership fees. And we haven't even started talking about the added costs of having to dish out farmer subsidies themselves instead of getting them from the EU.  They're also screwing themselves over for a worse deal as well, if attempting to negotiate access to the EEA. Given the huge disparity in trading power between the EU and Britain, they (Britain) have no real leverage for negotiations. Furthermore, they'll probably generate hostility with the EU for abandoning them, so will probably face a much tougher negotiation than most other countries would.
0/0	Find it genuinely heartbreaking when older people of the country vote leave and it's not even their future. #VoteRemain
0/0	Find the silver lining. The brexiters will be screwed over more than we remainers. It's a toxic way of thinking but those idiots deserve everything coming their way if they haven't changed their minds yet.
1/1	First - Why do the nations of Europe need each other so badly all of the sudden? France, England, Denmark, Spain, Italy (Rome), Germany and others practically ruled the world at one point or another in their history and in every case that was achieved while engaged in all out war with the other nations of Europe - not allied with them. Europe has become a sinking ship and England just got on the first life-boat. Second - I don't now how Vox and NPR listeners feel like they are superior intellectuals when you are spoken to like pre-teen children.
1/-1	First I would laugh for a good few minutes. Then I would be relieved.
1/1	First and foremost I voted 'Leave' for freedom as against 'Remain' in captivity. There is and never was any need for a trade deal.
0/0	First of all, I want to say that English isnt my native language, so sorry for the mistakes. For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist? Of course you can be proud of your country, but thinking It is the best in the world and that its habitants are superior to other people...that is absolutely anachronistic. Why dont we focus in what we have in common? We all are humans, we should stop hating each other and start helping each other. You may say I dont know how world goes and that It is impossible, but like gandhi said "be the change you want to see in the world". If you travel (at least in other Europe countrys) you will realize we are the same. I remember a picture of Merkel hugging Holland when the terrorist attack in Paris took place. That picture was very meaningful, because France and Germany have been in war the XIX and the XX century, and now they are two countrys in peace, helping each other. I think is easier to believe that things can change instead of hating everything. By last, I will love to think that Europe is only the begining, that we are going to just one nation, a global one. That is extremly hard to reach, so right now I'm content with making Europe a country. (Of course I know It has some things bad, and I want a well built Europe)
1/1	First stop the endless defense ATL of the ideology of Islam, otherwise your are fakeliberals.
0/0	First world countries politics crazier then ever
1/1	Firstly I think the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic organisation. I've yet to meet a single voter of any colour who can give a reasonably honest and accurate explanation of how the core EU institutions function in practice
0/0	For Brexiters it's all about fear and identity. Insecure numpties.
1/1	For Justice - Vote Leave!
1/1	For a country to be strong and successful it must make their own decisions. The UK by living the EU will be once again a country of leadership and respect. Congratulations UK.
1/1	For all those who love the EU so much and are afraid of governing ourselves which we did for at least a thousand years, the solution is simple, move to Europe. DONT drag us down with your idiotic politics.
0/0	For example the EU has over 100 free trade laws with other nations. It would take us well over a decade to become as free as the EU currently is.
1/1	For gods sake , why have they waited for over two years for this possibility ! Even the PM said NO DEAL is better than a BAD DEAL ! And I didn't vote for a deal ! I voted LEAVE !
0/0	For goodness sake see some common sense and cancelled Brexit before the country ends up bankrupt
1/1	For me it is not about immigration, it's not about the economy, it's about democratic accountability. The EU is anti-democracy.
1/1	For me it's simple. The UK is very different from Europe; in every respect.  The happiest and most prosperous countries in Europe include Switzerland and Norway; both non EU countries.  Britain had to sever ties with the Commonwealth as a condition of joining the EU. Sounds like shackles went on to me.  We've tried becoming European. We haven't and resist at every turn.  To prosper and be happy; leave the EU
1/1	For me there are 3 main issues. First is democratic accountability - the fact that the majority of power within the EU lies in the hands of unelected commissioners.  Second is economic - we are unable to negotiate our own trade deals and are forced to apply legislation such as the common external tariff, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. As the only EU country that does more trade outside the EU than inside it, we are disproportionately hammered by the EUs protectionist approach.  3rd is legal. The UK is tradationaly a common law jurisdiction whereas the EU is a civil law institution.  Generally, I am in favour of limited, localised and highly accountable government subject to the rule of law. The EU is in many ways the antithesis of that.
0/0	For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist?
0/0	For most people Brexit will mean a poorer quality of life due to a higher cost of living with prices rising due to inflation and a weaker trade deal or no deal at all.
0/0	For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together
1/1	For some of us Brexit is about not giving up our power and law to Europe, not having a European army controlled by one political power, not paying huge amounts of money into a European pot.... it was never about race or who was deemed as belonging just us choosing who crossed our borders for our own safety and security and the security of all Europeans within our borders
1/1	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave.
0	For the benefit of those who think No Deal means we stay as we are, it doesn't, it means we leave the EU on the worst possible terms with the worst possible outcome. If you want to stay as we are then you want no brexit.
1/1	For the first time ever, in my view, the arguments for us breaking ties with Brussels are looking more appealing.
0	For the first time in history Britain took the wrong decision leaving Britain the underdog reluctantly conceding leadership to France and Germany like USA concedes global leadership to China/Russia alliance and decide to be the new axis of evil.
0/1	For the first time in history, Britain took the wrong decision, leaving Britain the underdog, reluctantly conceding leadership to France and Germany, like USA concedes global leadership to China/Russia alliance and decide to be the new axis of evil.
0/0	For the first time in my life i am legitimately frightened about the future
1/1/1	For the informagtion of that Dutch girl I voted Brexit not because of some newspaper story but because I know what the EU is.
1/1	For wealthy countries, such as the UK, the cost of being a member of the EU is greater than the benefits
1/1	For what we sell to Europe it will be a very rewarding time for Great Britain to have a World wide market without the EU
0/1	Forced to accept EU laws? The UK are non-signatories of many EU schemes and legal frameworks like the Euro and Schengen area. As for the European Convention of Human Rights, this has been abused of late due to political correctness but it was a British construct and does provide several important protections
0/0	Forget drops. Drop BREXIT. Best bet for Britain is to stay with the EU.
0/0	Forgive me but I feel the fight has now gone beyond flippant humour. The UK is in serious deep shit with Brexit
1/1	Former Remainers are most definitely now argueing for ‚Äôsoft brexit‚Äô as a way to subvert the democratic decision of June 23.
0/0	Fox describes no deal as ‚Äúsurvivable ‚Äú. Not exactly glowing with confidence. A nuclear bomb is survivable , cancer is survivable as are most car crashes.
0/0	Fox news supports it  Ok now i'm worried
1/1	France has accepted we're leaving and is preparing for a No Deal exit.  So should we.  Let's get on with it. No Deal, no problem
1/1	France is the next! EU is a failure  proyect we are worse than in the past
1/1	Frankly I am amazed that these MPs are still walking about freely without massive protection after what they are doing!Its called treason!
1/1	Free at last ,free at last , thank god almighty free at last ...
0/0	Free movement has shown to be very good for both businesses and academia. It introduces diversity in approaches and ways of thinking, encouraging innovation and creativity, as well as business growth. An internationally acclaimed economy, needs international input if it is remain at the forefront of the world stage.
1/1	Freed from restraints in Europe, Britain could rebuild ties with natural English-speaking allies in the Commonwealth and strengthen the Special Relationship with the United States.
1/1	Freedom and independence from the EU should lead to wealth.
0/1	Freedom of movement from the Islamic world to Europe? If Europe wants to collapse borders within Europe it needs to secure borders around Europe.
1/1	Freedom of movement must be great for security.
1/1	Freedom over fear! Brexit now!
0/0	Freedom to trade outside the EU sounds great in theory but in practice I imagine it will be much harder than any Brexiteer cares to admit.
1/1	Freedom, Independence, National Sovereignty, Democratic Accountability: These things are much more worthy preserving and important than any possible, temporary economic disturbance or loss!!!
0/0	From Europe mainland point of view, the Brexit situation looks quite hilarious. Now, Corbyn has a good opportunity to become next UK's PM
1/1	From a Europeans point of view (who lived in UK for 15 years ) I really wish the UK would leave
0/0	From the French, we urge you to remain! Would you rather listen to Farage and Boris or the leading economists and world leaders?
1/1	From the beginning ever since 1992 I can see EU is a failure.
1/1	From where I sit in Australia, I cannot think of one good reason why the UK would stay in the EU.
0/0	Fuck Brexit
0/0	Fuck Brexit and all the little englanders.

1/1	Fuck the EU! Long live the UK!
1/1	Fuck the EU, just get out! You have my blessing! I hated being a tourist in Britain with Eastern Europeans all over the place!
1/1/1	Fuck the EU.
1/1	Fuck the remoaning traitors they didn‚Äôt want to hear the results of the vote either ..they need to grow up it‚Äôs called democracy or tough shit .. either one works
0/1	Fuckep up my dear chaps
0/0	Fucking Brexit - I hate you.
0/0/0	Fucking stupid, the last spiteful act of a generation of geriatric Little Englanders, abetted by the venal incompetence of the Conservative Party. But I think we're stuck with it now and calls to reverse the decision are pointless. Likely outcome is a few years in the wilderness, then if the EU is still around 10-15 years from now we'll meekly rejoin.
0/0	Fucking worse, its unlikely we will remain in the single market which is going to make it far harder to travel to Europe, like Trumpageddon its empowered the alt-right scum who are now ramping up racist and homophobic agendas in the place.
0/1	Fuk old its our time we need to decide wat our future will be they had there time wich they enjoyed going around EU
0/0	Fun fact: If Brexit meant that Britain would be taking more migrants in than before 95% of leave voters would‚Äôve voted remain. Why? Because the main reason for the idiots who still think Brexit is a good idea is those who only voted out because Nigel Farage promised fewer migrants never mind the benefits that where also promised like the millions that would go to the NHS which was like many others a load of BS. No intelligent Brexit voter would still be sticking to Brexit.
1/1	Funny I saw a poll in last week‚Äôs DT that quoted 58% now want to leave. And by the way child, not leaving is illegal.
1/1	Funny how the leavers are called the racists when it's us who want to engage with the rest of the world rather than just white Europe.
1/-1	Funny how the vote remains never have British accents .
1/1	Funny that, isn't it? The EU trading block is actually the worst economy in the world at the moment with barely any growth... even places like western africa have better economic growth.
1/1	Funny you all hate the UK but still want to migrate here.
1/1	Further reason to leave the eu

0/0	GBP will fall and gas prices will increase
1/1	GET ON WITH ENACTING THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE... TRUE BREXIT NOW!
0/1	Generally speaking it's better to have government closer to the people.  The EU is the opposite of that.
0/0	Genuinely I hope this all gets sorted, that somehow we end up remaining and you can get to come back to your new found home safely.
1/1	German welcome migrants because they knew they most of them wont stay but move to the U.K just as France,spain and italy.
1/0	Germany and France will suffer just as much if not more than the UK.
1/1	Germany have finally taken over Europe but they didn‚Äôt have to kill a single person this time. Very impressive. GET ME OUT!
1/1	Get England out of the EU #brexit #noEU
1/1	Get a backbone Mrs May, stop wasting time and just LEAVE. Do what we voted for. You are so weak. The worst PM ever. At least Thatcher has some balls. She wouldn't have stood for any of their nonsense, why are you?
1/1	Get away from eurocratic money wasters that all bow to the whims of Germany, and even many of their people want out too! We want to make our own sensible laws, have a say in how our money is spent
1/1	Get away from this toxic eu dictatorship out now
1/1	Get it done boris

1/1	Get out. Brits are better off EU. Britain doesn't need othet nations to survive.
0/-1	Get ready for the great (non) deal, kind of predictable that a weak leader & remainer would get a bad deal.... As for corbyn, are there really enough asinine sheeple to vote him into government??
1/1	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.
1/1	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.?

1/1	Get us out!
1/1	Getting out of the EU can be quick and easy ‚Äì the UK holds most of the cards
0/0	Gibraltar, Scotland, Ireland all voted to stay in the EU. They should be allowed to stay. England will be the nation that breaks the UK apart.
0/1	Give me one reason why we would suffer hard from it. With Brexit Britain can have a much better future.
1/1	Give the EU an invoice for the infrastructure we funded and will leave behind. Gott in himmel they are so arrogant. Do not answer the phones for a month after Freedom Day.
1/1	Give the above, stopping Brexit simply is not an acceptable democratic option
1	Give the whiny 48% what they want and let's be the Social Justice Soviet Union.
1/1	Give them a one way ticket to Brussels if they want to stay in. Simples!
0	Give us few days of no deal and Brexiteers will run begging for any kind of deal. You haven't seen anything yet. Brexit is a catastrophe
1/1	Give us our country back is all we want and voted for
1/1	Give us what we voted for, No Deal WTO actual Brexit
1/1	Given that i know nothing at all about trade and commerce, i can say that i do know about what it is that i and 17.4 million voters want at this particular time in our history, and that is--TO LEAVE THE EU.
0/1	Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run.
0/-1	Glad I'm not the only one who thinks brexit sounds like a breakfast cereal
1/1	Glad they listened
1/1	Glad to get rid of EU control,  they are gonna struggle without the UK
0/0	Glad to see that Justin Tr'udeau is adding his perspective to the debate. Hopefully a majority of Brits will heed the warnings of Britains friends and allies and vote to remain.
1/1	Globalisation serves the rich
1/1	Globalism is a cult presided over by self-serving corrupt pigs.
1/1	Globalism is dying. Protect your culture get out of the Eu poison
1/1	Globalism is slavery, central banking, common currencies, centralized government, corporate collusion in politics, flooding Europe with immigrants who detest our way of life, divide and conquer, order and enslavement out of chaos. Doesn't anyone understand the end game? The UK will bounce back economically in three weeks. This decision is historically the beginning of the end of Globalism. Be proud of it.
1/1	Globalist puppet
1/1	Go ahead with Brexit maybe one day we'll see an ItalianExit.
0/1	Go and educate yourself businesses are Leaving because we are on a sinking ship.. FACT. Remain.. Do you honestly want a government that wants to privatise the NHS have full power of your human rights.
0/1	Go away. Pack you bags, mount your unicorns and fly to Borisville. Idiots.
1/-1	Go boris we are right behind you
0/0	Go home Brexit you're drunk
0/0	Go on. Explain one economic issue that will be better after Brexit
0/0	God I cannot believe how stupid some of these responses are. Brexiteers are living in "make believe world" fuelled by posh boys' petty political ambitions. This BREXIT nonsense is happening and will hurt us all ...FACT not FALSE NEWS or SCAREMONGERING.
1/1	God I'm glad you are out of our union. Hope it works out for you, but the constant complaining was getting on my nerves. You are not even part of the continent, why were you in the EU is beyond me.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	God bless a free Britain
1/1	God bless the UK! You guys fought the first official fight against the globalists AND WON! Now I bet Spain, Greece, and others will follow in your path soon. I hope this also means that Hillary Clinton will lose in November
0/0	God damnit how did this get passed? Is this the work of crusty, aging, angry people who wont have to live through the fallout of this decision? My dads side of the family emigrated to Canada from England a long time ago but I still feel bad for what's coming to anyone left behind.
0/0	God said he is going to send down Noah to build a big ark to save 2 of everything British Cos Brexit is gonna make us sink into the channel lol .AFTER the fire and brimstone of course.
0/0	God to be able to go back to the days when the worst thing a politician could do to this country was the inelegant consumption of a bacon sandwich.
1/1	God, it makes me so happy to see true, patriotic Brits (and non-Brits) rebutting this buffoon and his platitudes, and backing Brexit.  Brexit is the only way we can save our country from the globalist nightmare that awaits Europe. Controlling immigration, being sovereign, trading with the world and rejecting cultural Marxism are all things to be proud of, and things any sane person wants - these things will be achieved with a Brexit vote.
1/1	Gonna miss Farage's speeches in the EU parliment. Won't miss the EU though.
0/0	Good Job Guys!!! now ¬£ = $
1/1	Good Lord! It's not a German cartel, it's a Jewish cartel! The same Jewish banking/corporate cartel that has started all European wars for the last two hundred years. For God's sake wake up already!
1/1	Good bring it on!!! Snowflakes go and melt
1/1	Good for Britain to shake off the EU.
1/1	Good for Britain!!! Soon as I learn what products come from the UK, I'll be buying it.                                                                       btw, did you hire a homeless girl to be your spokeswoman?
1/1/1/1	Good for the Brits. EU is a lost war.
1/1	Good for the UK! Seeing how the left wing media echoes the same non-stories makes me even more convinced to vote Trump.
1/1	Good for them. They will be free from the parasitic bankers that are sucking us all dry. I'm not a republican or a democrat but Trump could free us the same way. Even though I think he's a moron.
1/1	Good its about fucking time, we didn't vote for any kind of deal so just LEAVE THE EU as thats what WON the REFERENDUM.üëçüá¨üáßüñïüá™üá∫

0/0	Good morning. Fuck Brexit.
0/1	Good of them to admit they aren't ready - however forgettign the legislative mess, they need to resolve the Border issue or decide what to do about the Union. Ploughing on regardless doesn't solve that, it just messes things up.
1/0/0	Good old British empire.send I troops to blow up other people's countries....and now do not want to help the colatterel damage they have left...brtish empire became from global theft genocide and the rest...yep Britons stand tall and be proud..
1/1/1	Good step for britian. With love from India.
1/1/1	Good they leaving, this EU run by "LGBT sunshines" simply doesn't work. Long live to the UK
1/1	Good thing they left, now most of EU doesn't have to be influenced by the sharia law
0/0	Good time to remind Brexiteers that before UK joined EU it was known as the sick man of Europe. The EU enriched the UK, not the opposite. Now watch the opposite occur. Can still stop it though!
1/1	Good to escape from most corrupted EU.
1/1	Good to see some of the younger generation took the time to even vote, Remain or Leave. I voted leave. I couldn't see anything more illogical than the EU unelected, self appointed committee members & presidents casting their personal opinion over the wills of the people. No matter what country you are from. It should always be down to the Sovereign Nation/People to decide what laws to pass & how to conduct themselves, their culture & way of life.
1/1	Good, I wouldnt want to deal with immagrants either.
1/1	Good, walk away, WTO article 42 trade with e u whilenegotiating a new one.
1/1	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive
1/1	Good. France should leave the EU as well.
1/1	Good. Now just do a hard Brexit. The people have already had their say. It‚Äôs not for Eurocrats and politicians to overthrow that.

1/1	Governance by faceless bureaucrats, who are not representatives, will never end well.
0/0	Great (Britain) looser. They lost Australia, India, Africa, US and Canada, lately Hong Kong and now all well wishers (Europe)!
0/0	Great Britain is heading where they've been heading for hundreds of years - down the drain. In the empire where the sun used to never set, they've hammered one of the final nails into their own coffin and the hole keeps getting deeper. Right-wing-nut philosophy is working really well isn't it? The problem is, most of the advocates of this "me vs. the rest of the world" philosophy are not intelligent enough to realize that all the trouble-makers now and in history have worked their magic with a perverted sense of the very same mindset.
1/0	Great Britain is much different than the rest of Europe. An economy is much more than the currency or gold. economy encompasses culture and many other things. It makes sense for UK to be independent and deal with their problems; not be bogged down by mainland regulation and problems.
1/1	Great Britain is very smart to Brexit !!!!
1/1	Great Britain was a great country, before they joined the EU. They will be a great country when they leave. Sure, you'll have to disentangle yourselves, set up new trade agreements, but the benefits, are awesome. You'll govern yourself, austerity will end. No one will dictate to you, from a foreign country. A lot of Americans look up to you, for your bravery, and agree with you, for your ideals.
1/1	Great Britain will do just GREAT now they are out.
0/0	Great Britain. You've thrown your one future into the trash pit. You left the union your entire economy growth is based on. Now the EU only has to make one single sanction against you and you're DESTROYED. But then again, I'll laugh at you when you'll run back to the EU in a few years and kneel down to them asking if they could rejoin.
1/-1	Great fireworks, but if that was the Mayors tribute to Europe could he advise me how many of the fireworks were manufactured in the EU.... my punt is none.
1/1	Great for the UK on leaving the globalist elite union! The Revolution is starting! Great job UK!
1/1	Great job Brits! Take your country back! If only us "Yanks" could take ours back too....

0/0	Great news. Little England goes down the drain
1/1	Great result. UK has sacrificed itself to allow the other european nations to use the leave excuse as blackmail to change things into the union. Thanks UK, your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
0/0	Great to know we would survive. Wasn't the purpose of brexit we would all be better off ? What happened to the sunny uplands ?
0/0	Great video! I do understand how they-UK feel about leaving but I believe the UK is going to suffer because of the exit.
0/0	Great, not only will the tourist industry in Britain be hurt by Brexit, the entire British travel industry might perish because no one will dare to order any tickets .. well played.
0/0	Great. I don't give a shit about hanging on to tenuious lines that cavemen drew out on a map. The idea we need to remain an independent country is naive and stupid.
1/1	Greece¬†has become a case study of how the EU can destroy a country. It should be taught in universities. It is dreadful to see what is happening.
1/1	Greeting from Finland! I believe in you UK, vote against continued inefficient rule of the incompetent bureaucrats in Brussels, vote leave! If your nation manages to leave this crony establishment, other countries like mine will have a better chance to do so as well.  Good luck, and godspeed!
1/1	Grieve and the remainers want to drag it on until 2021 so that we have to participate in EU Elections, it brings in rafts of EU Legislation and allows for the EU to draft more! Most 'migrants' will have become EU citizens through residence rules allowing them EU passports and they STILL want freedom of travel! On yer bike! OUT, RIGHT OUT, NOW!

1/1	Hard Brexit is better than being enslaved by the EU rules and regulations without a say. No taxation without representation. The EU will allow trade within a few months after their businesses realized that they lost 66 million customers.

1/1	Has anybody else noticed that, although the BBC and others are happy to talk to both sides of Conservative MPs, the only Labour MPs they speak to are those who are in favour of staying in Europe (Yvette "I will take in a migrant family but haven't got round to it yet" Cooper being the lastest)? I don't believe for a second that all Labour MPs are in favour of remaining in yet that's the impression we are given. Their leader was in favour of withdrawal in 1975 yet tries to say that he wants to remain in yet his speech was hardly a ringing endorsement of continued membership - more "I suppose that we better had" rather than "It's in our best interests to stay". It's impossible to say where the economy will be next year, never mind in 14 years time so this is yet another scare story from the pro EU lobby. We have had two pro EU leaflets through our door so far - both have gone unto the recycling bin unread.
0/0	Hate me for this but we can't stop globalisation, isolation is not the way to go.
0/0	Have a friend who has worked in the Foreign Office for years and her reaction to how difficult trade deals were going to get should we leave were alarming. People don‚Äôt seem to have woken up to the skill drain that has left our shores since the vote took place. Over the past 40 years our negotiators have worked within the remits of the EU pact, most left after the vote as other countries headhunted them - many being EU nationals. Plus they were less than keen to lose the benefit of open travel. That, like the staff shortage in the NHS, means those who are expert in World Trade are few and difficult to find. Judging by the incredibly complex mess our politicians have made has only alienated those who the country needs to cast a better considered vote in a second referendum. Strange how discontent once fueled public action - but now mostly apathy.

1/1	He does not understand why Britain is strong enough. We need no EU industry or Euros. The British people have paid so much money to build up atomic bombs, atomic subs, and good British atomic country. Some Brits have nothing to eat and must even starve because of our wonderful atomic British world we have built up and paid for. The EU industry and money and the Russian oligarchs have to go - leave our country - we need no EU or Russian oligarchs!! They destroy our Britain!
1/1	He should be concerned as pro-EU-religious zealots have handed the men of violence a perfect excuse not to follow the demorcratic process by constantly demonising those that voted leave and doing their best to ignore that vote. So democracy doesn‚Äôt work; why bother?
0/0	He should be given a medal for standing and telling the truth, unpleasant though it may be to those dumb enough to be following a "Brexit" route. VOTE IN IN IN !!!!
0/0	Heart goes out to workers & families at Philips facing redundancy. Parliament failed you; I won‚Äôt give up on you.
0/0	Heartbreaking to have to leave
0/0	Hello  im a little bit late but one year passed and as a lot of Europeans i think you made a mistake. Stop being dominated by the old generation who voted for Brexit. Its 2019  get back here theres no point in leaving.
1/1	Hello, I'm from the future. We voted to leave
0/-1	Here come the leaver plebs
0/0	Here is what every country in the world is learning about brexit brittain. A completly self absorbed country unable to find common ground with anyone else or find solutions for common problems.
0/0	Here's an idea: if u can't deliver Brexit, don't do it!!!!
0/0	Here's hoping Brexit becomes the biggest disaster in the history of the UK.
0/0	Here's to bigots&haters who sold lies to the public destroying UK in the proces
0/0	Here‚Äôs an idea, why doesn‚Äôt the UK try to shape Europe rather than trying to hide away from it?
1/0	Hey britboy, just because an EU commissioner says something does not mean we should immediately switch to no deal. it‚Äôs worth the effort continuing to have some dialogue first.
1/1	Hey uk deserve the right to rule themselves.
0/0	Hey! I have only one question. We are many here in Sweden who buy electronics, clothes, spare parts plus many many more things via the internet from the UK. Sweden plus many other European countries have cars, tractors, machines, kitchenware etc. made in England. Many of those internet companies may lose a lot of money. We outside of the UK do not find British manufactured items anymore at an exemplary price. We have built up a security to buy goods from the UK that we can not find outside of the UK. Do people in the UK know how many people have a business relationship with Europe over the internet?
1/1	Hey, you must be a new kid around here, don‚Äôt you know thinking outside the Reddit hive isn‚Äôt cool? The mainstream media has told me that the EU are the good guys! No really, how does a ‚Äútrading bloc‚Äù turn into a ‚ÄúUnited States of Europe‚Äù with a military and no fucker is concerned. Full of tricks these folks.
1/1	Hi, actually from the Uk, and voted to leave the EU.
0/0	Hilarious stuff... and now all the leave voters are blaming politicians for this mess. This is the result of giving democracy to a bunch a people who have absolutely no clue about what they‚Äôre voting for. What a mess.
0/0	Hilarious. Europe say it will take years if we leave as do the yanks, but still brexiters continue to believe the uk will be fine. Tell me exactly who are we going to trade with??
0/0	Hilarious. Nigel should go to university and learn some rational thinking to replace the crap and lies presented here. It would appear that he has been milking Europe for years through your MEP salary and so called extra MEP perks. Both of his wives were non British. What a hypocrite. Cheers!
0/0	Hindsight from 2019 :D I have never seen a bigger shitfest than Brexit and I have seen 2 girls one cup :).
0/0	His grasp of the facts is beyond doubt however. Not that mastery of the English language tends to be much of a Brexiteer trait anyhow, having said that.
0/0	History will judge it harshly
1/0	Hmm, isn't self-interest exactly what Brexit is about?
0/0	Hmmm, given that Brexit is going to be a disaster whatever happens, No Deal is beginning to sound quite attractive if it makes the bastard Tories pay for their stupidity. Make them unelectable until the late 2030s.
1/-1	Hmmmm. Let me think ... who should we believe? A load of payed "experts" or..
1/1	Ho ho ho. Your liberal paradise of globalism and cultual Marxism is coming to an end.
1/1	Hogwash. The UK is one of the USA largest exporters, and only 3 or 4 of the other EU countries are comparible. Scaremongering and lies. I'm not falling for it. That's why I'm voting OUT.
0/0	Hold another referendum but this time do it properly and include everyone who has a stake in the outcome
0/0	Honest question from a remainer here. How do you imagine your life improving after Brexit takes place? Genuinely asking what effect you think it will have on your day to day life.
1/1	Honestly, I thought these people were team British. All these remainers should stop talking the country down!
0/0	Honestly, how there ever was a referendum without clear exit plan is utterly befuddling
1/1	Hooray my area voted leave. I can be proud of my area for more than just the virtue of being my area.
0/1	Hope those closed borders are worth it
0/1	Hope you guys eventually get to leave the EU.
0	Hopefully Brexit will be postponed for a couple of months, to when the weather will be a bit more warmer to sleep on the streets after we have lost our jobs and homes.
1/1	Hopefully Brexit will happen soon.
1	Hopefully more will leave, after the UK exit.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Hopefully other European countries will brexit too let those fascists fall
1/1	Hopefully we leave with no deal.
1/1/1	Hopefully we leave. I don't want to get effected by article 13.
1/1	Hoping the EU sticks to its position so we can exit with No Deal.
1/0	How Britain escaped (the sinking ship that is) Europe
1/1	How I smile everyday knowing that Leave won, and the fact Remaoners just can't except democracy...
1/1	How about Plan A, which was to leave and what the country voted for?
0/0	How about all the jobs that will be next to impossible if we lose freedom of movement?
0/0	How about if we don't leave at all. That seems to be the best option all round to be fair.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	How about no brexit at all
1/1	How about plan L. We just Leave
1/1	How about we pay nothing and the eu takes its illegal migrents back.
1/1	How about you leave the British people to decide. The sooner we exit the corrupt quango that is the EU the better.
1/1	How are people for an undemocratic superstate?
0/0/0	How bad will austerity get under a No Deal Brexit? Well, in 100 years time they'll be making musicals about it.
1/1	How britain lost europe. ..haha...what a brainless title...britain chucked the EU.... Merkel kick started the whole thing. By inviting 1.5 million Muslims to come to make their way to Germany ...Europe is still suffering repurcussions   of it now. ..with rises in the right all across Europe ...
0/0	How can Britain fix Brexit? Simple cancel it if it has any common sense left (which at this point looks very doubtful that it has).
1/1	How can anyone STILL be in favour of the EU.
0/0	How can anyone support political and economical suicide? Stop Brexshit now!
0/0	How can you vote for Brexit, you idiots?
1/1	How come all the immigrants are given social housing while we can't get it? and we have to rent private which is expensive. vote leave.
0/0	How dare these Europeans have competent politicians?
0/0	How did it happen that UK decided to leave EU without any plan? It takes years of preparations law adjustments even changes in construction to join the Union. Why anyone thought it would be easy to just leave it? Where is the plan B or C? I don't think the EU is flawless but if you want to leave you have to be fully prepared for all outcomes and have full support of the nation. There are many countries that 'want' (lately have new and/or more conservative parties more popular) to leave but after the brexit mess I don't think they will do it
1/1	How did we ever manage to elect a Parliament full of people that cannot even understand the meaning of simple English words... LEAVE IS LEAVE.
1/1	How did we tie the knot to be in the EU in the first place? I am not a psychic but I forseen that this marriage won't work 15 years ago. It's better to quit and get divorced. We can do a lot more and better than being controlled by the EU community. One thing Britain must do, is to re-gain her legacy and stop selling off our assets or privatisation of major/manufacturing industries. We must safeguard and regenerate our British values and heritage.
1/1	How hard is it to walk away from a deal........just tell the EU your done....
0/0	How is it possible to be team Brexit?
0/0	How mad we are to think Brexit would be positive! No gain....we should remain!
1/1	How many banks put family's on the street.we did not vote for brexit we voted LEAVE. she works for a bank that has up sticks and run ,You can bet you're life watch that same bank come crawling back when this country does better outside of the E.U.
0/0	How many companies have to pull out of UK/ stop investment/ close down before they accept that economic decline is the price for their xenophobic Disneyland?
0/1	How many more times, it's a Hard Brexit, we're leaving with a no deal....it's what the Brexiteers voted for...live with it. I'm a Remainer and I have.
1/1	How many more years do you give the EU surviving? The EU is just Hitler's New order. Pure EVIL. Where I lived in Oxford, every German family had EU stickers on their windows. If I put a vote leave sticker on mine, I would have no windows. The EU is brown shirt madness.
0/0/0	How many people who voted for Brexit still think it's a good idea?
1/1	How many votes do they bloody want, oh yes as many as it takes until they win, PLEASE SAVE US ALL THIS GRIEVANCE AND FECKING MOVE TO YOUR BELOVED EU, we will help you pack and have a party when you are gone please take the SNP AND NICOLARSE WITH YOU
0/0	How much did the economy grow in the UK since they filed for Brexit?
1/1	How much longer do we have to put up with all this rubbish ? Get us out now.
0/0	How much more *evidence* do we need before we accept that #Brexit is a right-wing ideology that'll only benefit the very rich? Its promises are a fantasy that can't be delivered. The damage will be huge & largely irreversible!
1/1	How on earth can anyone want to remain in the EU after listening to Tim Martin.
1/1	How on earth could one have even considered staying in the #EU? It was rapidly on the way towards being the western equivalent of the #USSR  -semi-autonomous member countries -ruled autocratically from a central location -by politicians with fealty only to the politburo
0/0	How stupid Brexit is
0/0	How was UK economy before joining EU or preEU in 70s? Trade deals, laws, and much more have shaped the UK to be 5th largest economy and EU contributed a lot into that in many ways.
0/-1	How would a no-deal Brexit affect the EU? That's the question.
0/0	How would independent trade agreements be more advantegous than those Brussels secures?
0/0	How would you feel if brexshit happened and you woke up, on 30th March, and was expected to celebrate because it's your birthday  Think I'm going to be very angry that day.
1/1	How you feeling this morning bedwetters, all your moaning, back stabbing and treachery has solved nothing only push the UK closer to a no deal Brexit. Poor Remainers must be getting a taste for losing.
1/1	However if Britain is leaving the EU it is also not able to participate in the process¬†of creating a more democratic EU. The EU is not perfect and needs to be adapted to be more efficient and democratic. However by abandoning it, you leave the decision to the other countries and watch from the outside.
0/0	Huge mistake IMO. Also, the fact that all it took was a simple majority to make such a drastic decision like that was another mistake on the UK government's part. A vote like that should require a 3/5ths majority imo.
1/1	Hungry, poor, greedy, corrupted EU keep saying ‚ÄúMy precious üá¨üáß‚Äù can‚Äôt let you go
1/1/1	I  chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited.
0/1	I  would dearly love to be able to take some blame for sabotaging Brexit. If it had been possible to slip a banana-skin under the whole wretched process, I would have. But actually, Remainers have been thoroughly sidelined and igored. All we‚Äôve been able to do is sit on the sidelines, with the occasion cry of "we told you that would happen".
0/0	I HATE YOU BREXIT I DONT CARE IM GOING MOVING LITHUANIA üá±üáπ GOODBYE NORTHERN IRELAND
0/0	I Hope Brexit can be avoided. The younger generation that will need to cope with these problems for decades to come. The British people don‚Äôt deserve this kind of punishment.
1/1	I Know what I voted for in 4 words "Liberty, Freedom and Democracy" aka BREXIT. What did you vote for?
1/1	I Know what NO DEAL mean for me, being out of EU, that is exactly what i voted for, TO BE OUT OUT OUT OUT, i did not vote for any deal
1/1	I Know what NO DEAL mean for me, being out of EU, that is exactly what i voted for, TO BE OUT OUT OUT OUT, i did not vote for any deal.
1/1	I SO can't wait until we're free from the shackles of EU rights and protections and are completely under the control of an unrestrained deranged Tory Gov who don't care that our stockpiled 'optimism' doesn't ACTUALLY feed our kids. It'll be fucking great. #JustBelieve #Brexit
1/1	I SUPPORT YOU LOVING YOUR COUNTRY!  I can only hope for a better path for the States - be nice to not send all my money to china and mexico manufacturing, and taking care of 10 million plus illegals from all countries with my tax dollars.  I want more in my paycheck - but I'm a hater to support a border for my country - bringing back the jobs.  The nuts are in the jar - but the more we keep out the better - and that begins at our borders and airports.  Britain is now again an island, I think Churchill would like that, you set forward a tsunami of change in the world.  A royal flushing, and the world needed that - and the people spoke - as they will in November in America - the silent majority want change too.
1/1	I Support Brexit and still do.
0/0	I absolutely agree with this piece; it articulates pretty much everything that motivated me to vote Remain and my current fears for our country. The lack of leadership both nationally and on the wider international stage is very worrying and I don't see anyone with the skills or vision to tackle the serious problems we face. Here in the Disunited Kingdom, we are lurching to the right and, as the piece says, hard-won freedoms are under threat. It's very depressing.
0/0	I absolutely despite Brexit; many of the people who voted to leave did so out of xenophobia, and the whole negotiation process has been a mess. Brexit has made me feel ashamed of my country.
0/0	I actually agree with you, which is why I voted remain. I don't think protectionism (be it in labour or markets) has any real positives for society as a whole.
1/0	I actually think that it would be quite bad for the UK to leave the EU. Its not a perfect marriage, but the full consequences and complications of that have not been studied properly and I don't think most people are really quite aware of how much uncertainty and volatility it will add to an already shaky situation.
1/1	I advocate leaving the EU, however my fear is simple. If the remain camp win this country will be nothing but a second class member of the EU super state, no longer self governing but controlled entirely from Brussels, Strasburg but mainly Berlin. The UK will have no say in the way the EU is run or funded, it will be the laughing stock of Europe. This country must I hope Vote to leave on the 23rd June.
0/0	I agree BillC. Use your head, vote Remain.
0/0	I agree and still my main reason for supporting remain is that they have enhanced our environmental and employment practices. Many Brexiters actively campaigned on removing these regulations and I don't trust those who brush those points aside.
1/1	I agree the Commonwealth of Nations will save the UK's economy
0/0	I agree there are plenty of things wrong with the EU, but most of them have little effect on our daily lives
1/1	I agree with Mr Davis ,but if the Government truely repects the will of the 17.4 million  they can follow Mr Moggs advice and close parliment which will put an end too the remoaners dirty tricks
0/0	I agree with the majority here. It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand. What still baffles me the most to this day is why Teresa May triggered article 50 when she did. Any kind of leverage was lost in that moment because she set the timer for the self-destruction mechanism.
1/1	I agree with the video, but even if Brexit was to make me poorer, personally I still would have voted to leave.
1/1	I agree with this and its one of the core reasons I want out. In my opinion the issue with immigration isn't the numbers, its the type of people. We should apply the same standards to european migrants that we do to non eu migrants and allow people in who prove they will give back. Its a disgrace we turn away hard working skilled workers from outside the EU while allowing any european in.  Just look at the comments from people like George Osborne to see how out of touch the remain campaigners are with immigration. His solution to curbing immigration is to tighten restrictions on non eu immigration- he wants to turn away more skilled immigrants to allow more potentially non skilled immigration. Who benefits from this because it isn't fairer for immigrants and it isn't better for the UK.  On an unrelated point, I think we should leave because the EU is unreformable (at least without a sudden direction change). Cameron gave it his best shot to get reforms and what they offered was a joke. "Change or we'll leave" is the strongest position we can negotiate from inside the EU and Cameron got nothing. All the remainers saying we'll reform the EU from inside fail to explain how we are going to trigger this change. What leverage are we suddenly going to get that will make the eu rethink its position? All staying in will do is tell the EU that the british people are happy and it will look like a green light to carry on. Whether we wish to leave for good or simply negotiate a new EU like relationship with Europe we have a better chance doing it from a position of power outside of the EU.  Staying in is not a vote to keep things the same and its not a risk free vote. The eu has changed drastically since the creation of the common market and its only going in one direction, it is taking sovereignty and binding countries together. If we stay in the eu who knows what state it will be in in 5, 10 or 15 years time. If we vote stay then decide to leave in 10 years all the economic concerns could be a lot worse, at this point we really should decide whether we are in it to the end or we should get out now. There is no shame in leaving, abandoning a sinking ship isn't quitting, its common sense.
0/1	I agree, Brexit would have been better executed under Farage
0/0	I agree, the UK politicians have been hugely damaging the UK. Luckily, being in the EU, only few noticed. As soon as the UK is out, all kind of problems that¬†so¬†far have been hidden will explode to everyone‚Äôs face‚Ä¶
1/1	I agree, we voted leave, SO, leave. The EU will come running when they realise what they stand to lose. We can buy direct from countries around the world. Leave the EU to swim in it‚Äôs own problems and leave us alone
1/1	I allways thought handing over control of a country to a foreign power is treason...
0/0	I always find it cynical of brexiteers who say they only wanted to be part of a common market. They are effectively saying they don't share the ideals of the EU, which was all about peace. They have an exploitative attitude but can't see the ugliness of it.
1/1	I am 100% for Brexit and I‚Äôm American
1/1/1	I am 23 and I support Brexit
1/1	I am American & I support Brexit, but I hate all Brexit supporters except myself for being antiCommunist antiMarxist nationalist hypocrites who only want to replace one form of collectivist oppression with another: nationalism (and christianity).
0/0	I am British and I'm relocating to a European Union country before I'm caught up in this shambles.
1/1	I am British and proud of it. The referendum was the first opportunity in my lifetime to have my say
0/0	I am European. Since 1993, as EU members, Britons have been able to live and work anywhere within the member states. This allowed me to live and work both in France and Italy and identify as European. Will future generations do and feel the same?
0/1/1	I am French but I support the brexit because I understand perfectly well that the English do not want to see their culture fall apart
1	I am a 20 year old who couldn't vote since I was a few months off. I would have voted leave and probably would still do that
1/1	I am a professional myself with board positions in several international companies.  I also voted leave.
0	I am actually scared about the referendum result. Too many people will vote out purely based on immigration and it's quite sad. #VoteRemain
0/0	I am against brexit, if things goes south we can always move to another EU country.?
1/1/1	I am an east African  living  in Sweden  and endorse  Brexit for many reasons.
0/0	I am ashamed of the 'insularness' of my fellow Brits. The future for mankind is for nations to draw closer together in harmony NOT to split apart.
0/0	I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out.
1/1	I am beginning to to think that people do not think like me or you? Or simply do not care? Maybe we are the crazy ones for wanting a safer better country.
0/0	I am completely lost by the British style of negotiations. At first I suspected that the lousy results were due to the intellectual low qualities of the British bunch of idiots d' village marshalling the Brexit but maybe its in line with the glorious history of British diplomacy which outcomes appears only on the very last day of the negotiations.
0/0	I am deeply disappointed because Politico published this article. And this is not due to the fact I am pro-EU. This is because the this article is highly biased and reckless.
0/0	I am fed up with Brexiteers in denial about the political chaos and economic damage that they inflicted on the UK, with the help of Catastrophe Cameron. The politicians are laughing at you. 37.5% of the electorate voted to make us all poorer. That's what you wanted and that's what they'll give you. They don't care, it won't affect them. They‚Äôll still have their jobs long after you have lost yours.
1/1	I am from Austria, I am happy about brexit.
0/0	I am from Romania and I met an amazing british guy in a hotel that decided to visit every single country in the EU because he feared missing this opportunity due to the stupid brexit
0/0	I am from Romania and I met an amazing british guy in a hotel that decided to visit every single country in the EU because he feared missing this opportunity due to the stupid brexit.
1/1	I am having my own bank holiday on 23rd of June. !
0/0	I am impressed how the EU has remained united and how it has negoiated. There two ways forward either we take the best route which is to stop Brexit or she drops her stupid red lines. At the moment she is trying for something that will not work. We need strong leaders who put the country first and provide us a way out of this disaster. The WTO approach makes no sense at all
1/1	I am in the U.S. and the media here is saying that if there is a hard Brexit, there will be food shortages, and the housing market will crash. I'm not sure why they are pushing this false narrative.
0/0	I am not being defeatist. I know referenda are very dangerous ways of deciding the fate of a nation - see what happened on 23 June 2016. Can you guarantee Remain will win this time? ¬†As a staunch remainer, I hope it will - but I am not at all sure.
1/1	I am not british but european....get out of EU !! We support you and will probably follow soon!!
0/0	I am now absolutely terrified that my family is going to split up. My wife is Danish and she may be forced to leave us, perhaps taking our 1 year old son away :(
1/1	I am old enough to remember joining the EU...we joined.. we didn't "crash in" so why are we "crashing out" we are leaving. Language is so emotive ...
1/1	I am proud of Britain. We Americans should Leave the UN and end all treaties with Mexico and other nations that are not in our best interests. We should do more trade directly with Great Britain and any other nations that leave these shitty one world government movements.
0/0/1	I am really looking forward for no deal brexit showdown ... it's going to be spectacular. In case of a no deal brexit, I'd say less then 30 days for UK coming back to EU. More popcorn pls.
0/0	I am sick and tired of Brexit. It's a bad idea that hasn't gotten any better with the passage of time and vast amounts of resource. End it with membership of the single market and customs union please... and a P45 for N Fartage.
1/1	I am sick and tired of the British always carping and whining about Europe. You want to leave? Then leave!!
1/1	I am sick of being told by politicians and newscasters alike that when I voted "leave" that I was mislead. I voted "leave" and with it, all its consequences, good and bad. REMOANERS get over it and stop trying to mislead the electorate.
1/1	I am so angry at the whinging politicians who are in total denial as to the result of the Referendum. They were given a clear instruction by the people : LEAVE THE EU.
1/1	I am so tired of the 2/3 argument. A choice not to vote is acquiescence to the final decision. Those under 18 have their rights to decide ceded to adults who have their interests at heart. We voted legally and lawfully. It came out Leave. Should it have come out Remain, I would have accepted it, voted to an MEP who would hopefully work to reform the EU and gone forward. I expected the same. Clearly not. The fact we have bungled the current process doesn't negate a decision made and the need to carry through with it. But hey, I'll keep your quote handy if we have a second Referendum and it comes out Remain. So we can go on to a 3rd, 4th and on and on until the EU builds a wall and asks us to leave or move to Canda.
0/0	I am still hoping to remain...
0/0	I am sure in a 1000 years, when the look back at the brexit mess, they won‚Äôt say ‚Äùthis was their finest hour‚Äù...
1/1	I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
0/0	I am truly sick to death of hearing Theresa May say ‚Äú the British people voted to leave‚Äù ! It‚Äôs a lie! Only 37% of the British people voted to leave . This is what she should be saying every time, she should not be allowed to say it as if it was all of us . Really makes me angry!
1/1	I am very proud of England for taking a stand, and I support them
1/1	I am voting leave for independents and more control to the people of England because I really disapprove of bureaucracy organisation I still to this very day accept the view that the Politian's should be in service to the public not the other way around.
0/0	I am worried but when I aired my concerns on facebook I got verbally shot down by an aunt of mine. I was just worried about the future but I had to laugh because it will likely be my generation who will have to deal with the ramifications of it, not hers.
1/1	I am, and always have been, a fervent Brexiteer. My concern however, is the potential impact on the availability of the medication that keeps me alive, and it's not trivial stuff, it's literally life and death. Quite recently I have given as much as ten days notice of my requirements of my medication, and they have not been forthcoming until the very last day.
0/0	I assume all the Brexiteers who hate being run by unelected bureaucrats will now turn their attention to the House of Lords & fully democratising it. That‚Äôs assuming most even know it‚Äôs role, history & function. I won‚Äôt hold my breath.
0/1	I back anything Putin wants to end

0/0	I believe brexit will do a lot of damage to England and English people
0/0	I believe that the United Kingdom will be more comfortable if we stay in the economic structures of the EU.
1/1	I believe this country will thrive and prosper in the years to come.
1/1	I bet I'm not regretting my leave vote...and there has been no post Brexit disaster!
0/0	I bet Ireland will never forgive the evil British. Serves Britian right that we Singaporeans kicked those colonists out of my country.
0/0	I bet that a mere year after Brexit kicks in a lot of Brits wish they were ‚ÄòRemanians‚Äô :-)
1/1	I blame the Remainers for consistently denigrating the UK economy and creating Project Fear stories . The latest such stories to bite the dust are financial services are relocating in their hundreds to the rest of the EU yet the number of job adverts for the UK is quadruple the number being advertised in the EU and it seems that applications from overseas to enter UK Universities is at its highest level ever contrary to the rubbish being spouted by University Chancellors. Even the F.T. has to admit very grudgingly the UK economy is doing much better than expected and is the EU economy of the big 4 which is actually looking the most positive .
1/1	I brexit my life constantly¬†#brexit
1/1	I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think the EU can be reformed. Once in a generation vote; I have to switch sides #VoteLeave
1/1	I can't believe that there are still people in the UK who think that they are better off being governed by this bunch of crooks in Brussels, with no hope of a reprieve.
0/0	I can't believe this is true 3 years on, but as someone who used to work with the EU, I find myself in tears about Brexit on a regular basis.
1/1	I can't blame them...I'll blame the bureaucratic EU instead
0/0	I can't help but feel that this could lead to a nasty turn of Events... Knowing that Britain might've played their cards wrong, I'd say that this poker game's won by the decision they've made as their money plummets down the drain... I have a slight gut feeling that this could result in a Britain version of the Great Depression. I'm American, but that doesn't mean I have extreme worry for other citizens that I could be friends with in another country! Prayers n' Hopes for the people out in Britain.
1/1	I can't shout this loud enough, WE... NEVER... VOTED... FOR... A... DEAL.
0/0	I can't sleep, can you? I am shaking with rage at the stupidity of this fucking shit hole country üí©üá¨üáß #StopBrexit
1/1	I can't understand any one who wishes to stay in the EU
1/1	I can't wait for Britain to leave the EU
0/0	I can't wait to be homeless. Thanks, Brexit
1/0	I can't wait to get rid of workers rights and farming standards. So much red tape for nout.
0/0	I can't wait to see you get Redpilled
0/1	I can't wait until these insufferable Brits are gone, kick them out, no deal, no access, no help. Stop begging and whining, just get on out the door, you're not welcome here.
0/0	I cannot believe we are subject to these bunch of clowns who really have no idea what Brexit will do to all of us.
0/0	I cannot help but be angry at the heartlessness of our country. The older generation have put thousands of people's jobs and homes on the line. My mum might be kicked out of Britain because she comes from France. My cousin is half Thai. I have no idea what will happen in the future, and to be honest, I'm scared. I am 13 tears old.
1/1	I cannot tell you how happy I am that we are leaving. It was the rise of UKIP that caused David Cameron to call the referendum.
1/1	I cannot wait till we leave the EU , we just want out country back....Leave means leave !
1/1	I cant wait until the 29th march 2019. Moment of truth for our democracy.
1/1	I cant't believe I live in a country with so many fools. How can leaving the EU be a bad thing? It is a bad thing if you are a self serving mep, banker, rich wanker etc..But if you are just an ordinary Joe like me this vote out is a beautiful thing. Even with all the dark forces against us(95% of media) we still won! Why? Because people are waking up to the tyranny currently rampant in this world. The 1% speak for the 99% and times they are changing. No more. I won't take this shit anymore from a so called elite. No more.
1/1	I can‚Äôt wait for Hard Brexit. It will be the best ever!
1/1	I care for our autonomy, vote leave!
0/1	I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited
1/1/1/1/1	I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited.
0/0	I come from a screwed up country, the USA. But from what I've studied is that Brexit will be a mess. When you are in a union you have more variety and power; no union is perfect, but it is better than nothing. The UK has cut themselves off from a more stable base as I see it.
0/0/0	I come from britain and BREXIT IS THE WORST DESCION
0/0	I completely agree. But it's both sides right? All politics comes down to emotions. "Reason can only be a slave of the passions."  Brexit is driven by nationalism, nationalism is driven by ingroup favouritism. It is opposed by desires for equality and liberty.  Desires have to be served by reason and reason has no desire.  The Tory Brexiteers are the custodians of that Nationalist desire, it is their duty to use reason to further that desire. The average voter that wants that nationalist desire isn't in a position to finalise that expression. This is the role of leadership to handle that desire rationally.  And what an absolute mess they have made.
0/0	I could not believe when the news came up that UK had left EU. I started to think about it,  and I think it is a loss for the EU. But it will be a higher loss for UK also.  Europe is big, diverse. Uk, cannot only deal with USA and China for trade. We all need each others.
1/1	I couldn't fathom another country making laws that our country has to abide by.
0/-1	I couldn't vote due to my age, and now I can't have the opportunities ALL the older people had gotten when they were younger. I can't freely move about in Europe, and have all the other benefits from the UN.
1/1	I deeply love my country and the things it has achieved throughout history and I don‚Äôt want it to become just another number in a nation called ‚ÄòThe United States of Greater Europe‚Äô
1/1	I did it because based on the information i had at the time, it seemed the best thing for our country And yes, i would vote leave again
0/0/0/0	I did not vote for this, my fellow countrymen are idiots
0/0	I didn't support Brexit at all. There seemed to be very little motivation other than anti-immigrant and fear-mongering.
1/1	I didn't vote 'Brexit' or 'No Deal', I voted 'LEAVE'! Listen to these morons desperately trying to save their own jobs by lying to the public. Twisted
1/1/1	I didn't vote as i live in France & felt i did not have the right, But my eyes have been opened since the vote just how corrupt the EU is & what little they think of the British people, It defies belief how they have behaved & i suspect opened many more peoples eyes who like myself were ignorant to what they are really like, We are not going to float Britain away on a large raft to the other side of the world & Europe will be still there after we leave hopefully with no deal now, We are just getting out of a bad deal & plenty of deals could be done in the future as we do buy rather a lot from them, Mr Farage reminds me of the Marcus of Montrose who was hanged & later given a state funeral for his bravery & just actions & maybe one day Mr Farage will receive recognition for his hard work & dedication for the good of the British people.
1/0	I didn't vote for a deal, I voted to LEAVE. T May useless.!
1/1	I didn't vote for cash or race reasons. I voted Brexit because global means complexity and more bureaucracy and less control. Gods save us from idealists.
1/0	I didn't vote in the referendum as I was overseas. But if I had I would have voted to stay in the EU as it didn't seem too bad at the time. But now I would vote in favour of Brexit.
0/0	I didn't want to leave the EU
0	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it
1/1/1	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it. Sometimes you have to get rid the the old before you can have something new.
1	I didn't watch any ads or any of the campaign material. I made up my own mind, and voted leave
1/0	I didnt think Brexit was a good idea originally but the more I learn about the EU the more I want it
0/-1	I didn‚Äôt even get the option to vote in or out because I was 14 at the time
0/0	I didn‚Äôt realise no deal would mean we‚Äôd lose the ability to spell the word ‚ÄúGovernment‚Äù!!! Brexit is fraught with pitfalls!!!
0/0	I didn‚Äôt wanna leave !
0/0	I do not hv any sympathy to those who talk of any Brexit without knowledge of the logical implications plus the massive short middle term damages to our economy and socially. The Brits MUST be fully aware Not to confuse NATIONAL PRIDE with COMMON SENSE.
0/0	I do not know much about David Cameron but why tf would you let your citizens decide on something so monumental of you yourself say that it's better to stay in???? It's a no brainer!
0/0	I do not see the EU as dictatorship. Quite the opposite. When I moved to Finland I did not have to get anyone's permission or a work permit. But if we leave I might even lose my right of abode and the same for hundreds of thousand of UK pensioners living in Spain ,Portugal, France etc... How is the Health Service going to cope with that influx? And many will need income support because housing costs are so much higher in the UK
0/0	I do not support brexit but i understand their reason and sadly the negotiation will be hard. But i do not like that ppl voted not knowing what EU truly ment. Ans misleading lies from the far far right was also wrong.
1/1	I do not trust the EU or its clandestine operations.
1/1	I do not understand why none of the politicians grasp the Immigration issue. OTHER THAN THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BY THE EU. We do not have the infrastructure to cope, this is a simple fact. OUR local school is 33% over subscribed, that AFTER substantially increasing its numbers. A Staff nurse at our local hospital said she is spending THOUSANDS a week obtain interpreters for immigrants who cannot speak English when they attend A and E or appointments. THIS out of the NHS budget. The same hospital is closing a ward due to lack of funding!!! The politicians in this country live in their bubbles NOT the real world. I believe BREXIT will not only shake the EU to the core but bring some normality back to this country. SAFER OUT I firmly believe.
1/1	I do not want to be part of federal Europe. We only ever voted for a trading partnership. Major signed the treaty without a public vote. The EU will not lock UK out of the EU because they can not afford to. UK will simply go back to the original treaty of the EEC.
1/1/1	I don't accept this analysis and I was a brexit voter.
0/0	I don't agree with the U.K leaving the EU
0/0	I don't believe in your plan, and will chose to pay my taxes in the EU wherever possible.
0/0	I don't believe that the nationalist nutters and their manipulators on the Tory right could carry a referendum majority any more, but how this plays out in our rotten, cowardly Parliament or under FPTP voting is anyone's guess. We need a People's Vote and we need PR voting.
1/1	I don't blame them for leaving under these circumstances
0/0	I don't blame you. This lovely country has been taken over by racists and morons. There is no future here. If I was younger I would move to Europe too
1/1	I don't care for economists. We need a NO DEAL :) Lets make Britain great again!
1/1	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets  That's what I voted for and that's what I want   I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets  That's what I voted for and that's what I want
1/1/1	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want
1/1	I don't consider Britain a European country anymore since the EU started treating us like fools when they were the foolish ones who have put Europe in such a financial mess
1/0	I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
0/0	I don't hate these people nor think they're all racist.  But they definitely are misguided.  They will be the first to suffer as working-class voters.  Where's all the huge amounts of EU funding going to come from?  The Leave voters were lied to, as officially recognised by official statistics authority.
0/0	I don't hold out much hope for the UK when ever after 2 years of negotiations people still cannot name the country they have a border with. smfh.
1/1	I don't know ANYONE who didn't know what the EU was, I don't know ANYONE who regrets their vote to leave.
1/1	I don't know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out.
0/0	I don't know whether Englishman are seeing this or not but they are divide and division will bring chaos .
1/0	I don't know your exact position but I will take a guess that ultimately this late on it is unlikely that whatever we or remain say will likely convince you one way or the other and it will probably come down to how you feel when the paper is in front of you. All I will say it is easy to just dismiss Brexit as the big risky option but before you do so, consider what Europe is likely to become in the next 5, 10, 20 years. No one can say for sure what will happen but the evidence suggests the EU will aim for greater and greater integration, possibly becoming a united states of Europe. The refugee crisis will almost certainly get worse before it gets better (only time I will touch on integration) and the problems with Greece and other economise will likely not get better for the foreseeable future.
0/0/1	I don't like sharing this sort of video. I prefer sharing clips of reasonable Brexit voters. But #NoDealBrexit is such a threat to our country that it needs to be put down. Hard!
1/1	I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it.
0/1	I don't really understand what the UK is trying to do here? They wanted out of the EU. Fair enough... That's their choice. But they still want most (If not all) the benefits of being in the EU... But without giving anything back as they're no longer a member? Seems very very strange.
0/0	I don't think Brexit is going to help people in Britain.
0/0	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK.
0/0	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK. On the other hand The UK should only stay in the EU if it wants to be in the EU. I'm not in favour of them remaining if they just remain because it's too difficult to leave.
0/0	I don't think GB realizes, that they would not just lose the trade agreements with the EU, but also the over 100 trade agreements, that the EU has with other countries.
0/0	I don't think it's a good idea, personally. There's simply too much red tape, and UK citizens are bound to feel an awful lot of pain if this goes through.
0/-1	I don't think most brexiteers are under any kind of illusion that there won't be any short term chaos.  But by the time any significant period of time has elapsed, and the damage becomes clear, the older voters will have died and the younger ones will have found other things to blame.

0/0	I don't think the average Brit knew what they were voting for. The conservatives ginned up the fear factor, like they do here, and scared them into voting for something that is going to screw them over dearly. I can't see what's in it for the power brokers who pushed for it but conservatives usually just want to take anything that is positive for the working class and wreck it. The Repubs are still battling the 'New Deal' over here 90 years later. The Brexit deal, like most deals, is not perfect but they will regret stepping away from the EU, especially as haphazard as things are panning out now.
1/1	I don't think the deal is anywhere near good enough for the United Kingdom. I will be voting to leave the EU.
1/1	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to
1/1	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to.
0/0	I don't understand British politics. Brexit just seems like a misguided isolationist/nationalist type thing. It's like when Trump wants us to leave NATO and shuns our traditional allies. It's sad to see the global community fall apart like this.
1/1	I don't understand why Reddit is so against Brexit? The people voted. Pure democracy. Everybody wants more power to the people. It finally happened. Now Reddit is outraged. Fuck that. Having the EU in Brussels make binding agreements for people in the UK. Joke.jpg. The only reason l can think people are against it is because a right wing government is in power, if it were left wing, reddit would be praising the Brexit vote. Shows how skewed Reddit is.
1/1	I don't understand why one person thinks a country will collapse if they leave. It was the same in the states when Trump was elected all the stars said they would move to Canada big deal.
1/1	I don't want anything to do with the EU it is a corrupt organisation run by incompetent bureaucrats.
1/1	I don't want the UK to be just another State in the US of E.
1/1	I don't want to be ruled by a foreign power any more I don't want a leader of my country telling me lies, that we are better off being run by this foreign power,
1/1	I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
1/1	I don't want to hear the argument of immigration is good for the country
1/1	I dont regret voting leave, and never will. Anything that shakes up the globalist elites and makes them shit their pants is good to me.
1/1	I dont understand why so many ppl that dont live in Britain think that brexit is so horrible this coming from an American but let them decide for them selves
1/1	I dont want another referendum i voted out i want no deal
0/0	I don‚Äôt believe brexit is the right idea, I don't believe it will work out well. We‚Äôre turning into a laughing stock.
1/1	I don‚Äôt care if the EU needs us or not I just want to leave
1/1	I don‚Äôt really see a reason for Britain to be in the EU Not my problem though
0/0	I don‚Äôt think Britain is better without Europe,reason is because 85% of business Britain do through Europe.you imagine for ones,this business we do through Europe to be with Asia Africa or us is match Moore expensive business to do.every thing imported will be doubled on price.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want Britain to be like that one person at the party no one wants to talk to #BBCDebate #EUref #Strongerin #INtogether
0/0	I don‚Äôt want brexit to happen
1/1	I doubt she (like many in the UK) likes the UK playing second fiddle to Germany alongside France in the EU very much.
0/0	I dunno, at this point it seems like a good idea to take a step back and reevaluate the situation rather than barrel through and force a Brexit that seems to be highly unpopular.
1/1	I expect my democratic vote honoured ,a full independent Britain and nothing less. Leave now so get it done.
1/1	I expect to leave the EU. No deal is fine by me, in fact its what I voted for.
0/0	I fear that Theresa May's determination is turning into sheer stubborness. It is absolutely obvious that a deal will need more than two months to be concluded. What's the point in pretending to ignore it ?
0/0	I fear the BrexiTraitors will succeed in destroying the UK economy for their own financial gain.
0/-1	I feel happier if we didn't have the worst government and weakest opposition in my lifetime. There's no clear direction of travel towards Brexit, and no real attempt to debate the process.
0/0	I feel like all the ‚Äòleave‚Äô folk in the comments section fail to display any form of intelligence (or literacy).
1/0	I feel like everyone is forgetting that Brexit was voted in?
1/1	I feel like voting against leave would mean the preservation of British culture and it's charm would wade and wade until there's nothing left but a lifeless machine at the whims of Eurocrats.
1/1	I feel physically sick when I hear Remoaners talk about job losses! We are fighting for our independence and sovereignty! WE don't care about job losses! We won two world wars! Out NOW!
0/0	I feel sick, I feel ashamed! You stupid ignorant people! Can I now vote to stop being British??? #Britain #VoteRemain #ashamedtobeBritish
0/0	I feel sorry for all the working, tax paying, rational people in the UK who wanted to remain but are going to feel the brunt of the pain from the xenophobes
1/0	I feel strongly that your country's insistence that somehow everything is to blame on 1 woman is a giant copout and part of the exact kind of thinking that got you in this mess: Short sighted, polarized and lacking any sort of nuance whatsoever.
1/1	I feel that when Britain leaves the EU we will be a shining example of an economy for most of Europe to emulate.
0/0	I feel that you are trying to be too gentle with this topic. The bank of England predicted 10% GDP loss during next 10 years, the british pound might have as well been renamed the british stone after leave referendum, the figures Brexiteers give are plain fake. UK needs EU more than the other way around, and Brexit, from an economics perspective, is a horrible idea.
0/0	I feel the leave campaign is purely built on a combination of speculation and bullshit. Remain on the other hand relies on information we have, and we all live in at the moment- which really isn't that bad.
0/-1	I felt sick when I woke up that morning and really just sad
0/1	I find it hilarious that May is threatening not to pay the biggest power in Europe, when in fact we can MAKE you pay by various means of taxation and customs rules. EU holds all the cards, you have nothing but empty pride.
0	I find it ridiculous that so many people in the UK want brexit. After all half of their trade is with the EU, if they leave they could really hurt themselves and so far nothing negative has forced the UK to leave, they were doing fine in the EU before hand, if it ain't broken don't fix it.
0/0	I find it sad that nearly 75% of 18-24 year olds voted to stay, yet the main demographic of the leave campaign was over 50s. Old deciding the future of the young.
1	I find it unbelievable that the Labour Party, including Northamptonshire Labour Party County councillors, support a second referendum. We had a ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Vote‚Äô¬†back in 2016 in which 58.6% of ‚ÄòDaventry‚Äô voted to leave the European Union. I will do everything I can to see this through and will never accept a second referendum.
1/1/1	I for one can't wait to finally leave the corrupted EU, to make our own laws/rules , in recent months alls we've seen is threats and bullying from the likes of macron, Michel Barnier and the other fools, It reaffirms why so many of us voted for Brexit in the first place. It's just a shame that we have in fighting in our political parties , the people made there choice to leave and it should be respected instead of everyone pulling in different directions. The EU is a failing economic model. Britain has been one of the leading countries in the world for half a millennia and we have done this because of our ingenuity and capabilities, not because we have been lead by bureaucrats. Project fear is in full swing with media outlets suggesting that we'll struggle with food and medicine amongst other things , it's a big world out there and with the likes of the US, Canada and Australia saying they will be glad to do more business with us I'm excited for the future of the UK away from EU bureaucrats . RULE BRITTANIA
1/1	I for one will welcome the return of more powerful hoovers when we finally leave!
0/0	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event.
1/0	I genuinely believe the EU is going to become the USA of Europe
1/0	I genuinely like your videos but you cited all the things that could go wrong with leaving the EU and none of the benefits. That is called Bias.
1/1	I glad I voted out
1/1	I got sick and tired of the constant political meddling - not just from Brussels, but our own politicians telling us how wonderful that meddling is.  We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise.  My area in particular has turned into Little Bucharest since the cap on Romanian/Bulgarian migration was lifted in 2014 and if you read any of the local press, reports of rapes, thefts, drink driving, the occasional murder (yes, really), and the perpetrator is very likely going to be called something like "Florian Iliescu" or "Elena Sandu". I was walking home one night and there were two police officers stood talking next to their cars outside the scene of what appeared to be a burglary, and I overheard one of them saying "... yeah, the Romanians really haven't been behaving themselves around here lately ..."  Life here is too easy. We are too soft a touch and the government deliberately refused to apply the brakes available to them - if migration had been properly controlled and managed instead of letting in everyone without checks, a lot more people would have gone remain. Everyone aspires to get to "England" and I guess countries like France and Belgium are third-world warzones these days.
1/0	I grew up in a British colony but I was of germanic/Indian extract. Now I am living in Europe in my mother country.  Growing up the British always got non British people to feel bad about themselves. Nothing overt but just enough to make one feel that you are inadequate. From India to Africa to the Caribbean you have a group of people that always felt that they were somehow less.  It freaks me out.  Now you have people like Johnson, Fox, Davis prancing around and actually manifesting that idea of supposed British superiority making others feel inadequate.  The British view of themselves does not correlate with actual perception.  I want the British humiliated not out of spite but rather because it seems that it's the only way to get through the self agrandisation.  The next elephant in the room to be discussed is the UN security council seat. Rationally it is something that the UK should willingly concede to India. The British are represented by the USA they have no right to it.
0/0	I hate #brexit and the #conservative lie ‚Äúprotecting sovereignty‚Äù, whilst selling off sovereignty.
0/0	I hate Brexit so much, i voted leave but i just wish i never hear about Brexit ever again.
0/0	I hate all this crap the Government are doing because stupid people didn't think things through. My thoughts are with you and everyone else who is in this situation, and all the other subsets of society they will round on when you have left this unpleasant shitstream of a nation.
1/1	I hate immigrants. Leave now
1/1	I hate the EU. They let our enemies in on mass. As far as I'm concerned the European council and parliament, and every institution they created can burn.
0/0	I hate the prospect of Brexit, and if I was old enough at the time would have voted remain. However, wishing death or ill will on anyone simply because they do not share your view (52% of the population) is disgusting.
0/0	I have always said Britain is the most reluctant country to change, modernise and update. Brexit is a prime example-It shows a country that refused to acknowledge that its empire was dead and never to be resurrected. It shows a country unwilling to co operate with a system it cannot rule over. It shows that it needs to rely upon nostalgia for its basic existence. It shows a country that has an education system straight out of the Victorian age. Britain is a an example of what happens when you fail to understand the world.
0/0	I have gone the other way, I just want the EU to completely fuck us over now, crash out with a no deal and no other trade deals in place, just a complete cluster fuck. Then maybe people will understand that voting for nonsense doesn't work
1/1	I have hundreds of friends and not one has changed their minds on leaving the Cartel. In fact, they are more resolute on leaving.
1/1	I have never had any sort of 2nd thought. I voted out because I am thoroughly sick of the EU - an anti-democratic genocidal construct designed to erase nation states and alter their genetic make-up. When you see people like Blair and Merkel getting the EU's Kalergi prize you know that is true - if you don't know what the Kalergi plan is, look it up.
1/1	I have never heard such ignorance. This idiot just stood on that stage and insulted everyone who voted to leave the EU. There is nothing wrong with nationalism and wanting to control your country's borders.
0/0	I have never thought that the Brexit result was legitimate. It was always a right wing Anglo American billionaire led coup. It is about ruling us more effectively by the Tory right wing.
0/0	I have no confidence in Western Civilization anymore... Brexit, France, Russia and Trump..¬† Its time for me to move Australia..
0/0	I have no words for those who voted Brexit
1/1	I have not changed my mind about brexit at all. Undemocratic multi-millionaires and celebrities are telling me it's a big mistake and the country will be destroyed. These are the same people with houses in France and Italy and bank accounts in Switzerland.
1/1	I have one thing to say: E.U. sucks and it is making the world worst
1/1	I have reluctantly voted to leave (I have worked for the EU and seen enough).
0/1	I have so far met two people who said they regretted their vote to REMAIN!
0/0	I have tried and tried to find positive but Brexit scares me so much I can‚Äôt help it, I am British AND European and will always be no matter what.
0/0	I have yet to find anything that, to me, would justify leaving, but there are plenty of things to be critical of the EU for. I have found the attempts to try and regulate every single thing frustrating, as logic is often missed. I have also been annoyed that they neutered paint stripper, due to H&S or something, meaning I can't get good liquid/gel paint stripper now and have to watch in sadness at the nice stuff in America (admittedly more toxic but fine if you use precautions) Recently they have gone back to wanting to ban halogen lightbulbs, this would pretty much kill the small theatre industry. So yeah, there are things I feel the EU does wrong, and aspects of the organisation that are frustrating, but it would be better to be in than out. We are only going to get screwed over by leaving.
0/0	I have yet to hear a convincing argument for the Leave side. I really get the in impression thay it's mostly just xenophobia driving it. Also, from my limited understanding, Scotland and Borthern Ireland are getting fucked pretty hard by this. Also, i feel bad for May. I think she inherited a dumpster fire here. I hope that in the next couple weeks the government decides to have another referendum, or better yet just collectively agree to forget this whole thing happened.
0/0	I have yet to meet any normal people on the continent who think keeping the UK is worthwhile. Please go off by yourself and sink your miserable, sad country, Brexit is really the UK unable to accept it is no longer very important.
0/0	I have yet to see one single positive thing to come from us leaving the EU, except some BNP, sorry Tory donors will avoid some very large tax declarations....
1/1	I haven't met anyone who regrets their leave vote.¬† No regrets from me.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders.
1/1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders. The fact that the British government has done everything it could to sabotage the will of the British public is just another example of the establishment wanting the pretense of democracy to keep people placid, but constantly undermining their own country for their own power and benefit.
1/1	I honestly think the UK, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands can survive without the EU.
1/1	I hope Brexit hurts the EU and gives it the kick up the ass it deserves.
1/1/1	I hope Brexit will deliver and succeed the Democratic vote...
0/0	I hope Britain does NOT leave the EU. Make the EU relationship work for you
1/1	I hope Britain makes it out of the EU to show the way for the other countries. I am pro European, but the EU nowadays is not
0/0	I hope Britain suffers. It's about time that history punishes them.
0/0	I hope EU will punish UK badly for such a horrible idea as Brexit. EU cannot afford spreading the idea of leaving the EU among its members.
1/1	I hope England gets independence
0/1	I hope Scotland secedes from the UK.
1/1	I hope UK leaves, that would be best example how country flops after leaving EU. Thanks.
0/0	I hope UK stay in EU. Im brazilian but i admire the European Union. Each coutry is better being part of it than alone i think.
0/0	I hope after voting to stay in the EU, the UK joins the Eurozone and let go of their outdated currency and join the 21st century. It will also make vacations in Europe easier and more efficient.
0/0	I hope for Scotland to declare independence from England and remain part of the EU.
0/-1	I hope my country Turkey will join to the EU soon
1/1	I hope other countries will leave the EU when they see how it actually goes.
1/1	I hope the EU burns to the ground
0/1	I hope the U.K does leave the E.U, I'm just not sure where it leaves Irish citizens, I've worked in the U.K for 5 years. I mean every generation of Irish people because of economic circumstances here in Ireland were forced  to go work in the U.K, long before any EEC-EU. Cameron was forced into having this referendum because of his own party and I think Cameron is fearful of the rise and support of U.K.I.P, we also share a land border with the "UK" 40 miles away, and 20 minute drive I am technically in the U.K. While consider the north of Ireland to be part of the Island of Ireland, I work with both currencies the euro, and sterling.
1/1	I hope the corrupt EU burns and crashes
0/0	I hope their is a 2nd vote now the lies of the #Leave campaign have been revealed. #Brexit #EUref #VoteRemain
1/1	I hope they get out, European Union is trash, especially coming after Google
1/1	I hope they leave
1/1	I hope those english leave very fast
1/1	I hope we come out of the EU. Its what I voted for.
1/1	I hope we do leave the Eu, nothing wrong with what these people are saying don't know why everyone has got to bash them based on it, at the end of the day the leave v stay polls at the moment are very close so no point giving these people crap because there's plenty of us that feel this way
0/0	I hope you stay, greetings from Germany
1/1/1	I hope, that EU will disintegrate.
1/1	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European.
1/1	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European. And I am afraid that that may happen
1/0	I just don't get why people aren't talking about the fact that britain simply VOTED on leaving the EU, they never actually left. Brexit isn't the main reason for this economic event
0/0	I just don‚Äôt think I really believed it would happen.... now I‚Äôm terrified it actually will. I mean how can something with no tangible benefits and a massive loss of personal freedoms actually happen
1/1	I just don‚Äôt think that Islam is compatible with the west. I just don‚Äôt think that people who believe in child marriage and terrorism should be in the United Kingdom, or Europe for that matter. That book poses a threat, and as long as that book exists there will never be peace in the west.
0/0	I just feel grief. I'm almost certain it'll be a no deal disaster at this point and that my generation are well and truly ruined. We're going to be the people shouldering the 2nd great depression, and the worst part is it's entirely the elderly's fault.
1/1	I just hope Britain can get back it's culture. It's such a shame that so much of Britain has been taken over. I pray that they will stay independent. Good for them.
0/1	I just hope that now EU will isolate somehow UK from the rest of the Europe so they can enjoy what they wanted.
1/1	I just voted Leave to get the Muslims out
0/0	I just want to put out there that I totally get it if Scotland wants independence from the #Brexit shitshow that is the U.K., and whether they are part of the U.K. or not they are our neighbours (and colleagues in my case) and I bloody love you.
0/0	I kinda feel bad for Theresa May. She was basically made the captain of a sinking ship where the previous captain held a vote on whether or not to sink the ship and then took the only lifeboat when, lo and behold, people voted to sink the ship. Now she's in a position where she obviously doesn't want the ship to sink, but no one can agree on how to patch the holes.
1/1	I knew exactly what I was voting for and still do not regret my vote to leave, in fact I want out more than ever before. I have not met one leave voter that has changed their mind or regrets their vote.
0/0	I know 52% voted for brexit, but times has changed since then and people have allready seen the effects now. As i see it, even with the corruption of the EU parlament, it is STILL worth it for britain to stay in EU.
1/1	I know brexit is frustrating and scary, but it's out of the box now. It won't go back in. We can either move through it, or be messing about with it for the next decade, perhaps even crashing out with no deal after all.
0/-1	I know it's a joke but isn't this an example of what Brexiteers mean when talking about sovereignty? Continually having to get EU's permission and how they limit us by denying us what we want to do?
1/1	I know it's not easy for upper middle class metropolitan elite types to lose to the riff raff that we all know you really think the rest of us are, but that you lost the argument, after investing so much in trying to win it. But this should be a wake up call, that involves some self reflection, but instead there has been an increase in the amount of trolling of your somewhat antagonistic views, that you inflict on the rest of us.
1/-1	I know most other people don't like EU because they feel the culture from their country will fade
0/0	I know this is trivial compared with the other reported disastrous outcomes of leaving the EU...
1/-1	I know what my father would have done to a traitor like Cooper if this was during WW2.
1/1	I laugh you:)))))economical level of turkey and salaries are better in turkey than in uk. please make more research.
0	I leave Downing Street 10 times more skeptical than I was before
0/0	I like the fact that all those Leavers are publicising the fact on their personal timelines that most of us want to Remain üôÇ
1	I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.
0/0	I like to feel more European then Brittish
0/0	I liked someone say in a comments section of a Brexit related video that Brexit is a warning what happens if one's ego and IQ are inversely proportional
0/0	I listen to 'Ruin My Life' by Zara Larsson when I think of Brexit
0/0	I live in Finland and i buy English stuff, but not any more if brexit happens
0/0	I live in France for a British company so I see all perspectives of this. Therefore my conclusion is for the UK to leave the EU is pure madness, and the UK would be hurt most of all.
0/0	I live in Scotland and I voted to remain within the EU. In fact the whole of Scotland voted to remain within the EU
0/0	I live in a true blue Tory borough in Surrey. Lib Dem's are the only party to say no to brexit! They've got my vote.
1/1	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country
1/1/1/1/1/1	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country.
1/1	I look forward to the UK reclaiming its sovereignty and sense of independent freedom come 29th March 2019. Rule, Britannia!
1/1	I love Brexit
1/1	I love Europe, but I hate the EU and the Brussel bureaucrats telling us what to do and when to do it with our own money. The EU is un-democratic.
0/0	I love being in the EU, I don't want UK to leave it.
0/0	I love free shipping, i love immigrants
0/0	I love free shipping. Stop brexit now
1/1	I love how the video is titled in a way that tries to put in peoples mind that Britain lost something...no the EU lost something.. a part of it literally removed itself.
1/1	I love remainers telling thicko leavers what they didn‚Äôt vote for- but as thick as we are we can smell a rat on Norway, 2nd ref. and extension of article 50 to discuss deal- what we did vote to do was LEAVE - and none of the above does that. As we say up north Let‚Äôs get gone!
0/0	I love that Leavers talk about this issue in terms of winners and losers!... No one won anything, in brexit we all lose together as country.
1/-1	I love the Brits. They‚Äôve nailed acting rudely in their politeness, and politely in their rudeness ‚ÄúHARUMPH, I SAY! HARUMPH!‚Äù ‚ÄúOrrdahhhh!!! (Order)‚Äù
1/1	I love the smell of Liberal tears in the morning .......smells like Victory. Make it a double in November Americans; then time to Liberate Europe AGAIN!!!
0/0	I love the stale reek of Brexit in the morning
0/0	I mean for my age, I guess I shouldn't be too concerned, but I keep getting paranoid thoughts about losing everything
0/1	I mean it was never much of a negotiation. More like the EU telling the UK what was acceptable.
0/0	I mean...impede brexit fuck brexit kill it just no one gives a fuck it ruins people's lives fuck Theresa may actually no don't she's probably got teeth in there anyway JUST GET IT OVER WITH OR DON'T GET ON WITH IT AT ALL!!!!!! FUCKING ISRAEL WILL BE BETTER THAN THE UK
0/0	I might not be there but I feel the pain they are suffering and are going to suffer.
0/0	I might see it wrong because i belave it to be extreamly stupid for england to leave. Tell me what from the EU affects any of you the english people personly in a bad way? I only see the media and the numbers of economy data but not the people so tell me pls.
0/0	I miss the good old days when Brexit wasn't part of our vocabulary. It never should of happened.
1/0	I moved to Finland I have a job here also I moved to Greece and Portugal and had full time employment there too.. I am from Wales I've done pretty alright with free movement üá™üá∫
1/1	I must admit, I have been pretending to be against Brexit for a while now because of pier pressure, it‚Äôs good to see that other people have spoken there minds üòÑ
1/1	I must assume that you came to this country because there is something about Britain that appealed to you. You came here, want to settle, and be British. Which means you have some stake in the future of Britain, right?  The elephant in the room in the brexit debate is immigration, and we're not talking about high skilled, educated, legal immigrants like yourself. We're talking about the other immigrants. The unskilled, illiterate, and ultra-religious.  These people are going to destroy British culture. They come here and do not integrate. Indeed they cannot these people are illiterate in their native language, speak no English (and no intention of learning), cannot get a job here, and come from a culture that is antithetical to our own, and (given our birth rates vs theirs) in 20 years there will be more of them than there is of us.  This country that you've chosen as your home will not be here in 20-30 years if this continues.
1/1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday. A no deal is even better! Get us out! teresa May is traitor these politicians are traitors, and they should be trialled for treason. People said Out!! Out!! We want Out!
1/1	I never voted for any deals... I voted to All out LEAVE the EU and Single Market Bloc!!!
1/0	I never voted out for this shit deal now let's have a revolution
1/1	I never, ever,ever go on holiday to Europe. I would rather eat my own p o o !
0/0	I often travel into the EU to play live music. That's my career fucked then.
0/1	I personally believe that all the Brexit shebang was organised by remainers in the EU to better integrate UK into EU structures. Letting Britain to crash out of the EU, suffer serious economical consequences so they would crawl back begging to accept them back to the Union, but only this time they will have to integrate fully - adopt Euro currency, enter Schengen zone, lose all the Opt-outs and Vetos they currently have. It's an EU master plan and only blind can not see it. (slow clap üëè)
0/0	I personally didn't vote to leave I voted to stay the concequences and repercussions we will have from leaving the eu will continue to grow and halter our economy.
0/0/0	I personally don't think it was a good idea at any point.
0/0	I personally feel very worried for the future. The value of the GBP is still 20% less than what it was and seems to still be dropping. I'm also annoyed that 16-17 year olds were not given a vote (They were given a vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum, but not in the EU Referendum). I'm disappointed that people decided not to listen to experts on the subject, instead tuning out the academics in favour of the Daily Express. I'm disgusted by the increased number of hate-crimes against minorities committed by people who feel that such behaviour is acceptable, and I feel uneasy about the future. I feel just as nervous about it now as I did on June 24th when the results came in. All I can say is, thank god for dual citizenship,
1/1	I personally voted to leave because as a teenager at school when we voted to enter EEC i was taught how great free trade would be.At the time no one was aware of the loss of power,laws and stupid EU laws and more important no vote on the leadership of the EU.If you don't like how your country is ruled you vote in another party,that doesn't work in the EU.To me it was not about immigration it was the fact we where not told how the EU would develope. May be the older generation felt hoodwinked in the past.I like the idea of the EU but not the way it is turning out.
0/1	I personally voted to leave, along with a number of my friends from university and college.  We did so on the basis of economics, aware of the fact that leaving would result in several years of a reduced economy, but firmly believing that our government would be capable of negotiating more prosperous trade deals outside of the EU, while also maintaining the freedom of movement for EU member countries and the UK to maintain a positive relation with the EU. This would also encourage more economic migrants to enter the UK due to improved trade opportunities, etc.  However, what we ended up with was being lumped in with a load of ill-informed racists, a load of Tory sensationalism, and frankly, one of the most pathetic first-world Governments I've ever laid my eyes on.  At the time, I believed that David Cameron could suck up his pride and help negotiate a prosperous deal for all involved (albeit at a short term negative outcome for the UK - that was always a given with the Leave vote and I was prepared for that), but instead he dropped out, fucked off, gave us Theresa May and essentially said "well I know I said I'd stick by what the people wanted, but what I really meant was 'I'm a Tory and you should have known better'".  Anyway, suffice to say I now regret my vote. But hey, hindsight is 20-20.
0/0	I pray for a second referendum. I prayU.K. will remain in the European union
0/0	I pray to God we the United Kingdom remains within the European Union!!!! because the UK is much stronger inside the EU. Remaining in the EU opens up more doors towards prosperity for us. PLEASE VOTE REMAIN ON 23RD JUNE
1/1	I prayed for this day
0/0	I predict that the only thing in defence of a no-deal Brexit is just that it will show every nationalist idiot what Brexit truly means
0/0	I prefer to stay in the EU
0/0	I promise to vote stay this time.
0/0	I read somewhere "Brexit will go down in history as the worst case example of direct democracy"
0/0	I realise that but Brexit will be far worse.
1/1	I really hate the eu
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU.
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything
1/1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything.
1/1	I really hope people come to their senses and vote to leave. The EU is a straight jacket that is taking the very life-blood out of the nation states. It is an empire doomed to failure as it is built on idealism in that all member nations can be squeezed into the same mold, whereas nations need realism and the freedom to develop. All the UK really needs is being part of a free trade zone, nothing else as we can sort out all our own problems.
0/0	I really hope the Queen steps in and fixes this. I know she does not want to do things like that, but she almost has to.
0/0	I really really really hope we stay
0/0	I really really wish we did not leave the EU. I would not be at all surprised if many people emigrated from the UK. This country's finished. People in this country are so selfish.
0/0	I really think this European Union project is the greatest achievement for all people on this continent
0/0/0	I really would like some politicians to be honest enough to say ‚ÄúYes, Brexit is really, really shitty, and we‚Äôre all going to suffer from it, but hey, you voted for it, so we‚Äôll do it anyway.‚Äù
1/1	I really would like to see a no deal Brexit. Just to learn who was right. I really foresee UK economy getting crushed, but lets just wait and see and get ourselves some popcorn. Greetings from Europe.
0/0	I realy wish that the EU would work, we need unity in Europe so that we can remain a powerful nation amongst China and the US
0/0	I refuse to be discouraged.  We can still stop Brexit. Let us have a second referendum.  I know it is dangerous - but at least we will have tried to save our country from a deep and prolonged recession
0/0	I remember feeling shocked when I found out the result of the referendum. I didn't expect it at all. "Why would you want to leave the EU? That's just a plain stupid thing to do. So arrogant to think you would be better off alone" I thought.
1/1/0	I remember the 1997 general election as it was the first I could vote in. UKIP were a tiny fringe party. From that to Brexit in 20 years is astonishing.
0/0	I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion but I think we should stay! The people‚Äôs vote has been decided even if it was based on lies.
1/1	I saw a video on facebook where an official guy claimed that leaving the EU meant leaving Europe altogether, which is BS. I saw another where an official warned that if we leave, the prices of all goods will go up, especially ice cream.
1/1	I say Hard Brexit is the best. The EU is falling apart and never had the self interest of any of the members in mind to begin with.
0/0/0/0	I say give us a second referendum. Give us a chance to stop this nonsense.
0/0	I say no to brexit. Are you listening Theresa?
0/-1	I say we don't stop at the EU. Let's get the British to leave the planet. They can be the first Mars colony which is good because they are used to bad weather and food.
0/0	I see a bright future for GB... in the gutter!
0/1	I see a lot of Leavers online threatening civil unrest if we remain, but now also threatening civil unrest if we leave with a deal... If they start shouting that a bit louder would that not in itself be a good case to remain?
1/1	I see the EU is getting desperate, look anyone with half a brain knows Brexit is the best thing to happen to the UK, lies and misinformation will not change that
1/1	I see the ilk of those who encouage EU membership, and know,out is the enlightened choice.
0/0	I seriously think, brexiters may have some sort a brain damage from social media or smth to want such a thing.
0/0	I sincerely hope EU workers in England and Wales will move to Scotland and help us in our bid for Independence from Westminster to secure our place in Europe.
1/1	I spent a decade living in the remnants of the CCCP, the greatest failure in social engineering in history. I know exactly why I wanted a Brexit. The removal of a centralised, behemoth of a self serving bureacracy.
1/1	I still believe it will be the best for the country in the long run. It's also interesting to see how the lies on both sides of the campaign are coming to light.
0/0	I still can't believe how people voted to get out of the EU. Why you can't give a chance to the immigrants? Fucking dickheads #brexit
0/-1	I still don't know shit about this issue. I get that the UK wants to be more independent, but wasn't the whole point of the EU supposed to be to enable Europe to compete with the United States' massive economy
1/1/1	I still don't regret voting to leave the European Union. Every time I see a politician whining, or trying to undo the vote it makes me even prouder to have voted Leave.
0	I still don't understand why people thought it was a good idea. It really does seem like those that voted had no idea what the EU does and what they were voting for.
0/0	I still don't understand why the UK want's to leave the EU.
0	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame
0/0	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame. They'll just divert it elsewhere. And the average people on the streets are the ones that will suffer.
0/0	I still suspect Brexit's going to be called off!
0/0	I still think it'll all end in tears.
1/1	I still want Full Fat Brexit !!!
1/1	I strongly feel it would be a mistake to remain in the EU which is part of the Globalist architecture which will do nothing good for the working man in the UK.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I support Brexit )
1/1	I support Brexit and the UK can save high dues to the EU.
1/1	I support Brexit. Cannot happen soon enough
1/1	I support brexit and why most people I know support brexit
1/1	I support brexit because article 13 passed and I want my British memes
1/1	I suppose I should say that the politicians that pushed for no brexit should be put in jail, but I believe in democracy - you don't seem to understand the concept, you talk like a nazi.
1/1	I suppose a big part that voted for leave voted because of uncontrollable immigration from 3rd world countries at the time. Even political campaign was all about this at the time and not about economy.
1/1	I suppose that the good news is that NO older remain voters are dying off. Consequently the Remoaner vote will be in the majority. Yeah! Dream on. We‚Äôre leaving. Get over it. You pro EU lot are all the same. If you don‚Äôt like the result, keep voting until you get the result you want. It‚Äôs happening in Italy. The EU wanted to insert a pro EU Finance Minister but the Italians won‚Äôt have it. Now, another election. But this time the Italians will vote the same way as they have had enough of your beloved EU.
1/1	I suspect it is not only the Brits who will soon be demanding the freedom to opt out.
0/0	I think #brexit and #VoteLeave is a mistake. We should stay in the #eu and reform. Calm heads needed #eureferendum
1/1	I think Brexit is a chance for the UK. And you should proceed to leave on the 29th March. I even think a No-Deal-Brexit wouldn't be such a bad thing.
0/0	I think Brexit is a mistake
1/1	I think Brexit is good but am swayed by the biscuits argument.
1/1	I think Brexit is good. We don't lose as much money. we can control over our laws, trade etc. Immigration control.
0/0	I think Brexit is the most silly thing anyone could‚Äôve voted for
1/1	I think England should just rip the band-aid off and leave. It's a good move for them.
0/1	I think No Deal is better than a bad deal. May must go and a true Brexiteer Patriot should replace her as PM. I will never, ever vote Conservative again if Brexit is Brexit in name only and I'm not the only one. There will be blood on the streets if government doesn't get us out free and clear of the EU. Just look at us now pleading to leave like prisoners just think how bad it would get if we remained and don't forget we would have to accept the euro, all of Europe's migrants and debts and all of their rules too. No, we want to be free of the evil EU chains that bind us and as English men it is our sovereign and legal rite to be freemen. Those who try to take or give away our sovereignty and freedom whether in government or not are traitors and should be treated as such.
1/1	I think UK did a good job concerning Europe. Brexit was exactly the kick in the butt the EU needed. I hope the bureaucrats finally understood how dire the situation is, and that UK one day may join in again, when the EU has become a democratic institution.
0/0	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far
0/0	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire.
0/0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire. The UK, strong, can rival anyone in the world by itself, so why would it surrender its sovereignty? Except that it's not the case anymore, as the great European nations of the 19th century (UK, France, Germany...) fell behind the behemoths that are China, the US... Unified, however, the EU is clearly top 3 in all matters, and best in some. Also, I am quite disgusted by the ton of disinformation we have seen during the campaign. UKIP is by no means better than Trump and is largely to blame for this folly.
1/1	I think it will open many many doors. We can trade with whoever we want, however we want.
0/0	I think it's dumb.
1/1	I think it's great that Britain left the EU because the EU just look out for their selves and their own country
0/0	I think it's only a matter of time before the best vote with their feet and move - to where I'm not sure given that the idiots have removed our freedom of movement. Tragic times ahead.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I think it's the best decisions Britain has made in a long time
1/1	I think it's time for the UK to prioritise it's citizens. What is the use of having your own Parliament if the EU will not respect or honour your country's law?
0/0	I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. Especially if it‚Äôs hard Brexit, from what I know it‚Äôs practically guaranteed to destroy the economy. It seems to be founded on a form of ultranationalism that attempts to justify that it‚Äôs okay to destroy your country in order to reject cultural pluralism.
0/0	I think most of ppl in UK (not Scotish,i have to say that) are stupid (mostly old persons) because they dont understand what EU really is.It's easier way to transport goods,money,people and stop at this point because PEOPLE means a lot in UK,i mean they hate non-native persons like polish people (18 children in 18-20 age attacked adult 2 polish persons who talks to each other in polish and they was beated by them,was is dead and 1 is hospital,thank you so much for beeing tolerant :D).UK community doesnt understand that refugees will be always,that doesnt mean "if UK leaves EU we wont have refugees :D",IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT.I am done with people like them.Older people who are untolerant and dont understand what they did to whole Europe and their economy.
0/0	I think most of us in Europe are hoping for a no-Brexit scenario.
0/0	I think our own policies are far more damaging. Self imposed austerity. A government that only responds to one demographic. The eu was keeping those cunts in parliament in check. But I guess you're fine with having corporations fucking us over (and the richest of them already do, cos our government is as limp as a geriatric when it comes to tax from the big boys) . The supposed cut in red tape will be more, again benefiting the big multinationals rather than small independents. Prices are soaring. And yet our government still had its finger up its own arse. There are simple answers - scrap brexit, because it was an ill informed shit show of a referendum. But I guess you want less accountability and more power for an increasingly authoritarian government.  Globalisation is here to stay. Brexit is not going to stop that. I would even argue that with a weakened government the big corps will be able to dictate even more. But that's OK for you as long as there is less Europeans on the street, serving you coffee, picking the harvest and generally contributing to society, while the majority of these half brained brits complain that washing dishes is beneath them.  Fuck all of you brexiteer cunts to death, fuck you
1/1	I think people are starting to forget that that tiny island controlled almost all of the world at one point in history,leaving the failing EU will be seen as the greatest moments in British 21st century history.
1/1	I think people of Europe should try their best to fix the EU before dismantling it, there are too many dangers for Europe if EU gets destroyed - large countries being able to easily bully us being one of them. UK should be allowed to fully leave though, they voted for it and it should be honored
1/1	I think some of the Brexit people remember why we joined the EU in the first place. It was only for trade. Once we were in it started to turn political. This is not what we initially voted for.  Pretend you are out of the EU now with free global trade (Europe included), we controll all our own laws and borders. Would you vote to join, knowing what you were going to give up control of? I certainly would not.  Immigration is a MASSIVE issue. Actually what I am against is UNCONTROLLED immigration. This in itself causes some peoples blood to boil.  And remember, there are ~50 countries in Europe, 28 of which are in the EU. All these countries trade with the EU just fine.
0/0	I think that Brexit is bad for the UK because if the UK left the customs union and the single market the British economy would be damaged significantly
0/0	I think that Brexit is leading to impaired governance, social anxiety and squeezed living standards.
0/0	I think that Brexit is not good for both the Britain and EU.
1/1	I think that, all considered, Brexit will be good for the EU.
1/1	I think the British are so wise they leave while they still can.
1/0/0	I think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything
0/0/0/0/0	I think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything.
0/0	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for.
0/0	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for. A lot of people don't even realise the meaning of brexit sadly yet it's such an important decision that will impact the future generations.
1/0	I think the EU is great. Yes, it does have problems, but which country doesn't? If we stay united we will find the solutions.
0/0	I think the UK is shooting itself in the face.
0/0	I think the first thing we'll see after Brexit is the exodus of young and bright talent from London to major European cities like Paris, Amsterdam or Berlin.
1/1	I think the idea is that we will have to conform to less EU laws
1/1	I think the majority of Brits care and will vote to leave they are seeing through the rhetoric.
1/1	I think the point about this referendum that terrifies a lot of people is that it is the Elite (in) vs the people (out). The Elite controls the political agenda which creates a lot of frustration for lesser mortals who can't find a voice.
0/0	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer.
0/0	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer. The people that are still shocked we would do something as stupid as leave the EU have become the dominant voice... Well outside of the news entertainment channels.
1/1	I think this seems totally like a good idea. After Brexit we‚Äôll have taken back control of our waters and stuff.
1/1/1	I think this sums up just how out of touch the liberal left are with real people, the sooner we are out the better.
1/1	I think we can learn a lot from the Brexit by watching it unfold. If it is a positive effect for their country, I believe the US should follow them by leaving the Chinese union.
0/0	I think we have embarrassed ourselves and that whatever the outcome, this country is going to be a less pleasant one.
1/1	I think we will hugely thrive outside the EU. it will be a painfull adjustment but one worth taking
1/-1	I think you'll find we did address whether there is a real movement for leaving the EU on 23rd June
1/1	I tormented myself over whether voting for Brexit was the right thing to do. I have grandchildren. Now, more than ever, I would vote Leave. To remain scares me almost as much as Jeremy Corbyn!
0/0	I truelly believe that EU can do things that Nato cannot. #NoBrexit
0/0	I understand patriotism and love for ones home, but the Brexit is bad for the EU but devastating for the UK. Citizens need to listen to professionals on this matter not their emotions.
0/0	I understand that people want change but reacting to fear by cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will only make it worse.
0/1	I understand why people felt the way they did, but it‚Äôs not helpful to anyone.
1/1/1	I used to be against Brexit but now I'm for it.
0/0	I used to feel rage, but I just can't sustain it for three years and I've got other things to concentrate on, so now I feel resignation, exasperation, weariness.....You could call it Brexit Burnout, I guess.
1/1	I used to love Corsica and Italy,ruined by the EU.Salvini trying to keep Italy Italian.
1/1	I used to vote Labour, i will not vote for Labour they backed Remain I would rather vote UKIP as they backed Leave.
1/1	I value my nations independence and achievements and believe this will be seriously and irrevocably crippled by becoming just another cog in another superpowers arsenal.
1/1	I value these opinions, but I still think if the cup of tea wants the tea bag to remain, it needs to let the tea bag call its own shots on matters like border security and immigration
0/1	I vote for civil war if the establishment screw us over
1/1	I vote out b/c I want England to be for the English, simple as that.
0/0	I vote remain.
1/1	I voted Brexit because of O'Brien.
1/1	I voted Leave (and would do so again)
1/0	I voted Leave - and I was well informed. So if there was another referendum then I'd simply vote LEAVE again.  The only thing which has changed for me over the past 2 years is I never realised how biased the politicians are, how one sided the media are and how deluded remoaners are.

1/1	I voted Leave because I don't want to be part of the United States of America, any more than the United States of Europe.
1/1	I voted Leave but had to think long and hard about it, now, absolutely leave, 100%
1	I voted Leave to restore our independence and freedom after 43 years of control
1/1	I voted Leave, I consider myself a centrist. Happy today
1	I voted OUT of the EU. I would vote out AGAIN and AGAIN and again and again and again and again and again. No one ever asked me if I wanted to join the EU.
0/0	I voted Tory all my life. I never will again. They will take us to destruction of the economy because of their own desires to lead their party. When this hurts the poorest and the economy is reduced I will not forgive them for hurting the poorest more even if the poorest may well have voted for it on a campaign of what i believe were lies and false promises.
1/1	I voted brexit I don't want to be told what to do by another country I don't have a problem with foreigners coming into this country to work and let's face it they are keeping this country moving why you like it or not
1/1	I voted brexit, because of the lies about funding for the NHS. I'm a mental health advocate, and everytime the NHS does budget cuts, they take it out of the mental health system
0/1/1	I voted brexit, because of the lies about funding for the NHS. I'm a mental health advocate, and everytime the NHS does budget cuts, they take it out of the mental health system. I really do believe the mental health system is one of the most flawed, frustrating and horrible things to have to deal with; and it's in dire need of changing drastically. My choice had nothing to do with immigration, it was purely to help the NHS. however, after finding out that that promise was utter bullshit I feel betrayed and seriously regret my decision. I wish I wasn't so ignorant at the time.
1/1	I voted for Brexit ... and you sound like a remoaner!
1/1	I voted for Brexit in 2016, and would vote for it again today, if ever they held a second referendum. If anything, the events that have unfurled since 2016 - the EU trying to "punish" Britain as an example to others, showing that the club they pretend is so wonderful is actually Hotel California - have confirmed my long held view that EU = totalitarianism soft. Go away, Mr. Macron, your people hate you.
0/0	I voted for Brexit ‚Äì and now I realise what a terrible mistake I made
1/1	I voted for Brexit, and did so with the expectation that there would be a short-term economic downturn as a result. Why would I do such a thing? Perhaps because I weighed up the options and realised that the best plan in the long-term would be to leave. Are you aware of any of the democratic and economic issues that leave voters voted on?
1/1	I voted for Brexit, as did most people I know. Would you like to know some legitimate reasons why people votes for Brexit? 17.4 million people voted, it isn't because we're all stupid or want to harm ourselves.
1/1	I voted for Brexit, but I have no qualms with a powerful, federal EU. I'd much rather they be the most powerful economy in the world than China, or India.
1/1/1	I voted for a NO DEAL BREXIT.............. Did YOU?
1/1	I voted for brexit for various reasons but the main reason is the lack of transparency in the EU.Most people I know cannot name even one MEP .
1/1	I voted for one of the options given, to leave, not hang around waiting until the EU decides to give us a really bad deal.
1/1	I voted leave and I would still vote leave if given the choice.  Before you lot jump to the same argument i always see on the sub reddit Immigration was never a key point for me and I would happily accept free movement and even free trade with the EU (which was the agreement under the EEC long before Orwell's nightmare existed). I would also be happy finding it. After all what is a few million to a great trade deal and happy more stable neighbours.  However I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain. In the mean time we all have to deal with an unelected President and commission (who control all the power) and a parliament that acts as a smoke screen. It genuinely makes me sad that we live in a country where so many want to willingly abandon the democracy we fought so hard for in exchange for trinkets.  As far as what I think of this new deal I despise that to and I believe this was our Prime ministers plan all along to give us a terrible deal and say "it's this or no brexit". So you lot may well get your dictatorship after all and I hope it's worth selling what little freedoms we have left to our multinational overlords.  This is truly what it felt like to be a roman after the fall
0/0	I voted leave and deeply regret it. What have I done to my country? I was influenced by lies and illegally bought Facebook ads. I didn't do any research about what Brexit would mean.
0/0	I voted leave and do regret it now. I now think its a fucking stupid idea.
1/1	I voted leave and don't like either labour or the tories. I can't see workers rights being eroded like some are claiming. Any party that tries to get rid of maternity leave, sick pay, holidays etc will be fucked in any future election
1/1	I voted leave and i can assure you it's not all about immigration. I love Europe and european people, it's just that our democratic rights are completely drowned out in the EU in favour of large businesses and a collectivised economy.
0/0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind.   It was a stupid  choice.  New referendum is needed
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind. It was a stupid choice. New referendum is needed
1/1	I voted leave and proud!
1/1	I voted leave and would again  A leave vote means more chance of Scottish independence, at which point Scotland can join the EEU & Schengen
1/1	I voted leave because the EU has become corrupt and unaccountable and does not serve the people.
1/1	I voted leave because the EU is going to collapse, their trade laws are problematic for the UK, their immigration policy causes many problems, so on
1/1	I voted leave but I didn‚Äôt really want to leave Europe
1/1	I voted leave but surely that post was a joke. If not I can only assume a trained gorilla has acquired keyboard skills. I am ashamed to be associated with such utter tripe. Giving leave voters a bad name and fuelling leaves ammo, muppet.
1/1	I voted leave meaning clean break out of europe totally. No deal and keep your grubby hands off the British tax payers 39 billion.
1/1	I voted leave that meant leave!!!!!!!
1/1	I voted leave, and it wasn't because of "immigration" or because i am "uneducated" or "racist". I want the EU countries to get better and stronger there shouldn't be a reason to leave your home country, your country is to provide for you, that's jobs healthcare, education, and a home if one of these things is the reason you have to leave then there's a problem, and its with your own country that things needs to change. Using the British or any other nations tax payers  money is shameful. I know i said immigration wasn't the reason i voted leave but the people who come here for work thinking its a good thing are wrong if you have too immigrate here just to get a job then your home country has let you down and NEEDS TO CHANGE! Britain and its money wont help change the core problem which is too many EU countries cant provide for there populace and use the free movement of people to pass the problem to others like the UK and Germany, France. I voted leave to make the country's in the EU stronger because hanging on another nations apron strings isn't the way to go.
1/1	I voted leave, i couldn't give a f..k what rich people think. Just get on with it !!!!
1/1	I voted leave. Everything you're talking is rubbish.
1/1	I voted leave. I am a migrant to the UK from outside the EU. My parents worked hard all their lives here, and we are happy as a family here. We never claimed benefits, and we have paid taxes and contributed to our local communities. I ended up marrying a foreign woman outside the EU and went through a challenging process to get my wife a VISA. All other migrants should be prepared to do the same, and not treat the UK as a transitional home. The government and it's people have the right (and a duty, God forbid), to put it's own interests at it's forefront - I fail to see why this is even an issue? This time democracy won - and people continue to complain? Why?
1/1	I voted leave. I wish I had put a bet on the result. I believe the odds for leaving at 10pm on the night was something like 8 to 1 or something around that figure
1/1	I voted out ,I win u lose..
0/0	I voted reject Brexit. I am a British national living in Spain, the EU has been hugely beneficial to me.
0/0	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again. I do have valid gripes against some stuff the EU does, and there are issues that may never really be resolved (common agriculture policy/fisheries policy etc). At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger.
0/0	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again.

At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger. At least one preferred option for trade after brexit would cost businesses here more than we used to pay the EU (by multiple billions, based on estimates) Thanks to the leave vote the economy is now doing less good than it was, the military is even more underfunded due to the exchange rate crashing, xenophobic and racist attacks saw a huge surge after the vote as well.  Basically every week is another bad bit of news about something we are losing, something damaging our country and something going wrong, as a result of Brexit and voting to leave. NHS recruitment is a big one. We are now looking at probably decades of austerity, and once we actually leave, it will likely get pretty shitty. As it is, things are not too bad yet because it is a long gradual process.  Thus far, there hasn't been any real positive news at all out of this whole debacle.
0/0	I voted remain and I regret the over all vote, but this video is ridiculous..
0/0	I voted remain and if we were to have a second referendum I would vote remain again. However, what happens if we lost again? The people's vote campaign looks awfully similar to the first time round. Wealthy individuals and middle-class students making a lot of noise in the major cities whilst willfully ignoring the concerns of those outside of London, Manchester, Liverpool etc.
0/0	I voted remain but I can see how the EU has a serious democratic deficit and that is unsustainable and they are not planning to change.
1/1	I voted remain but having watched how bitter and twisted the E.U. have treated Great Britain the quicker we are to leave, the happier I will be.
0/0	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK.
0/0	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK.  I might not agree with it but it‚Äôs silly to dismiss half the country as stupid and racist.
0/0	I voted remain but respect the views of the those who voted leave. To call people racist just because they wanted to leave the EU is not only wrong but insulting.
1/1	I voted remain but would now vote leave.
0/0	I voted remain in the referendum because i believed all of this mess should have been delt with first.
0/1	I voted remain, and I am against a 2nd referendum. Well all knew what we were voting for respect the decision and work together.
0/0	I voted remain, and if I had a chance again would vote remain again !!!.
0/0	I voted remain, but London will remain a world financial centre whatever happens.
0/0	I voted remain, but if I had voted leave then I would be all wrapped up in the sovereignty nonsense, and I would be pretty disappointed. Or the other one they all deny is that they simply don‚Äôt like foreigners, well I would have mixed feeling there, they certainly were successful in reducing the number of doctors, nurses, health professionals coming to work in our National Health service.
1/0	I voted remain, but that odious fellow crapping on the House of Commons because opposition exists within it makes me want to leave immediately with no deal.
0/0	I voted remain, love Europe and its people
0/0	I voted remain.
1/1	I voted to LEAVE. Did I vote to deal? No! No! No!
1/1	I voted to kick out immigrants so the rich have to pay real wages
1/1	I voted to leave
1/1	I voted to leave as did the majority but the London centric establishment
1/1	I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
1/1	I voted to leave because I the voter and taxpayer have no democratic control over the machinations of the Commission
1/1	I voted to leave because QMV is undemocratic and that since 2009 any decision against the EUs‚Äô agenda to consolidate its own power and to increase federalisation fails because of QMV. Britain doesn‚Äôt want a closer federalised union, the EU does, these are two irreconcilable viewpoints. But hey ho, it's much easier just to call me a stupid uneducated racist right.
1/1	I voted to leave because open door immigration is irresponsible when a country that Housing, Hospitals,Doctors and many other services are struggling to cope. I don't have any problem with anybody from the EU or any other country coming to the UK but the numbers need to be controlled so public services are not overwhelmed. While clueless politicians put whats best for the EU before the UK
1/0/1/1/1/1	I voted to leave for independence and i would vote leave again, Our prime minister May is the problem not Brexit.
1/1	I voted to leave purely because of sovereignty.
1/1	I voted to leave the EU because I want the British economy to collapse :)
1/1	I voted to leave the EU. I rejected a supranational government. What would it take you to understand the danger to democracy the EU represents
0/0	I voted to leave,and I regret that‚Ä¶
0/0	I voted to remain in the EU. There were never any benefits to Brexit which weren‚Äôt massively outweighed by the downsides, even if we‚Äôd had a competent government to take us through the negotiations.
1/0/0/0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
0/0	I voted to stay
0/0/0	I voted to stay because I knew brexit was going nowhere from the get go
0/0	I wait to see how many work dodgers will come off benefits to fruit pick or dig up potatoes in all weathers then!!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I wanna stay in the EU

1/1	I want Brexit, the british people would be saved from article 13
1/1	I want UK to be a democratic global trading nation instead of being tied to decaying and undemocratic EU
1/1	I want UK to be independent and NOT a EU' province !!
1/1	I want a hard border at Dover to keep the EU out of GREAT BRITAIN
1/1	I want an independent country!
1/1	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for
1/1	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for !
1/1	I want hard brexit and then we can invest that 39 billion into our own car factories, plane factories etc. The government should provide OUR people with tax free loans to start up new enterprise ! We want NO DEAL !!!
1/1	I want my Country back
1/1	I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
0/0	I want the UK to STAY in the EU
1/1	I want the UK to make it's own laws
0	I want the UK to stay in European Union forever...
1/1	I want the laws that we are governed by in Britain to be made in Britain & to be made by people who can be held to account by the British electorate
1	I want to leave because: 1. the EU is fundamentally undemocratic - only the unelected commission can propose laws, the parliament is a mere amending chamber - there is no true separation of legislature and executive. How many years did it take for us to secure universal suffrage and its now being destroyed under our noses without people realising what is going on. 2. the vast majority of our laws are now made by the EU, and they are now unashamedly pressing on with an EU army - ie. we aint seen nothing yet 3. The EU is controlled by big business, big banks, Soros etc- its run by the establishment for their own benefit, the people no longer count - look at the tricks that are being played out now as the will of the people is regarded with contempt as it does not fit in with the establishment line 4. 20 billion quid a year to pay for this when an increasing number rely on foodbanks and essential services are still being cut. 5. The Euro has crippled most of southern Europe and is stopping the richer members from developing economically 6. Our country is being subsumed into this dysfunctional superstate when it could be a leading player in world trade 7. Open-door policy has led to a flooding of the lower paid labour market with a resulting compression of wages
1/1	I want to leave the EU so Britain can rule Britain again.
1/1	I want to save our country from becoming part of a united States of Europe, don't believe me read the treaties.
1/1	I want to see an end to the corrupt EU Dictatorship, No Deal will hit the destruct button for them.
1/1	I want to set Great Britain free and lets start trading with the other 85 Countries and be proud to leave the EUROPE BEHIND.
0/0	I want to stay in EU to help keep peace in Europe.
0/0	I want to stay in the EU.
1/1	I want us to make our own decisions. Europe is a mess. Let's fix ourselves by ourselves
1/1	I wanted to stay in the EU. But I voted to leave. He depicts those who voted leave to be old, xenophobic, less educated and nationalists. All my family are Irish including myself and I also have a BSc (hons) degree and I love to travel around the world where I enjoy meeting and speaking to others. I also have dated other ethnic people. So how do I fit into your bullshit narrative.
1/1	I was 20 when I voted to leave and I have no regrets. I want us to be able to have our self determination as a people and stop the EU, a state too impoverished to pay it's own debts but brand us British as criminals for wanting to rule ourselves. The sooner we leave the EU the better. Hopefully then we can have freer, fairer trade with every nation in the world.
1/1	I was 22 when I voted for brexit now I'm 23 and I will still vote for brexit.
0/0	I was a member of the Conservative Party. I campaigned in past for it. After this I will never vote Conservative again. Brexit is nothing other than economic suicide which will only benefit the mega rich like Rees Mogg, Murdoch etc..
0/0	I was absolutely gutted by the result. I still feel we should have remained in. However, it's vital that the British people unite to make a success of this. There are definitely opportunities and if 48% of the population stand around whinging we won't have a chance of making this work for us
1/1	I was completely for BREXIT. In fact, I would be happy if Germany pulled out of the European Union and stood on her own feet. Being economically the most powerful country in Europe, why should the Germans who worked hard to attain this status share their wealth.
1/1	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'.
1/1	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'. The more I learn about the ambitions, unaccountability and record of the EU and the Commision the more I am against it. How could the manufactured migrant crisis happen? It took the stripping of national sovereignty and overt threat of retaliation from Brussles to enable this catastrophe. And Britain will not be the last to abandon it's membership- you can count on that. Thank god.
1/-1	I was not surprised.I was expecting this for a long time..............
1/0	I was thinking of moving to Britain for work but brexit will destroy everything. On the other hand Europe is useless, maybe brexit is the best solution for Britain and that's what matters the most
0/0	I was woken up early by the thought of how I would feel if #Brexit happens. It's not good. Intense despair would be one emotion, and extreme anger and hate would be another. If a few million people feel like me, this country will be heading for very bad times.  #StopBrexit
0/-1	I weep that anyone even needs to be told this. Why the hell are we so bloody stupid.
0/0/0	I will NEVER be bullied and blackmailed into accepting any form of #Brexit. May's deal leaves us permanently weaker; Corbyn's deal would do exactly the same. Give us a #PeoplesVote. Otherwise, martial law is on all who brought us to this point.
0/0/0	I will be registering to vote this week. I will be voting to stay in the EU.
1/1	I will be voting leave because I believe that Britain must be a self-governing, democratic independent nation in order to ensure that it both preserves it's cultural identity and delivers economic prosperity for generations to come.
1/1	I will expect my democratic vote honoured a full independent Britain, No deal is the deal. We never voted for deals we voted out.
0/0	I will miss the UK! I think you gave up too fast. Of course the EU is far away of beeing perfect but to say good bye...a little bit childish!?
0/0	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support negation of what has continued to be an extremely successful peace project in Europe
0/0	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support restrictions on my children's rights in the world
0/1	I will no longer be involved in day to day anti Brexit activism on social media
0/1	I will put us back in
0/0	I wish for Britain to get poor and isolated after Brexit. No immigrant should ever come there as the British pound will be valued less than a US dollar. They would have long quees in the EU Embassy to get the Shenghen Visa. UK would lose all investors and all automotive industry to Ireland, no more Range Rover, Jaguar, Mini Cooper with the right wheel drive. That's gonna be a show to watch
1/1	I wish i had the resources to produce a pro-brexit video of this quality.
0/0	I wish non of this was happening
0/0	I wish the UK wouldn't leave the EU, we can achieve so much more if we are united.
1/1	I wish the best for UK Be unite Be united kingdom Be independent
0/1	I wish the older Brexit supporters would show a little compassion to we the young who will after live with there vote to leave instead of refusing to countenance the fact that we will suffer for years to come.
0/0	I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit. My country is a laughing stock right now.
0/0	I wish they get it over and done with. I voted Remain for lots practical reasons (work, travel outside EU etc) but even I wouldn't want to stall the exit.  The big problem is the uncertainty. I don't trust the leaders to make decent decisions but they have to at least decide something.. no one had a plan... idiots.
1/1	I wish we could leave as well ...Good for you Brits, lot's of respect for taking your country back ... a frustrated Belgian civilian.
0/0	I wish you the best UK citizen, for a dark time is coming and this one smells like 1930's. I will mourn your leaving next year, whatever it means to you Brexiters
0/0	I wished I could of voted to remain.
0/0	I wished we wouldn‚Äôt leave the EU
0/0	I wonder how low can UK sink? Lost its empire, about to lose its economic might, will likely lose some of its provinces. We could be talking about England pretty soon.
0/0	I wonder how many pro brexit people would change their vote rightnow.
0/0	I wonder how will Scotland and the Northern Island react if the Brexit will really happen!! Hopefully they move away from the UK and join the EU

0/0	I wonder if the Queen‚Äôs applied for a German Passport. #Brexit
0/0	I wonder why people who want to leave EU never give one good (or at least sensible) reason to do so...
0/0	I work in the construction industry and know for a fact that young Brits are not attracted to the trades in the volumes they once were. The British workforce has got steadily older with the shortfall being filled by younger EU workers. The UK construction stands to lose up to 8 per cent of its workforce to Brexit putting the delivery of future infrastructure projects at risk.
0/0	I woudl have thought the Europeans would be so pissed off by us by now that they would be more then happy to kick us out by now. *ashamed to be english*
1/1	I would be over the moon if we left the self serving, thieving, lying #EU with a #NoDealBrexit They have taken enough from the people of Great Britain
1/-1	I would be rich beyond my wildest dreams. Moreso the population will see growth in manufacturing and jobs galore. If you listen to the remainers their only output is about project fear, these are the smoke & mirrors tactics of the elites and the establishment in the UK & EU.
0/0	I would continue to vote reject Brexit simply because brexit has already made some companies quietly relocate out of the UK.
0/0	I would have Brussels before British any day
0/0	I would like a video explaining why some people want no deal. Majority of the evidence ranges from bad to very bad. Thanks.
0/0	I would like to see the leavers acknowledge their error once it starts hitting, and not divert the blame or project on others. But yeah, we know that is not going to happen. We know immigrants and the poor will get the blame for the crisis. They steal jobs, they take welfare, and they don't work -all at the same time-.
0/0	I would like to vote but as I have lived outside the UK for more than 15 years I can't vote. However if the UK leaves it is likely that I will have to leave my job and return to the UK where I probably wont be able to find work so I will end up living on the dole and costing the UK tax payer money.
1/1	I would never dream of voting Tory, and I am fully for Brexit.  How does that fit into your condescending worldview?
1/1	I would never in a million years change my decision to leave.With the EU being exposed for what it is I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would want to remain and belong to such a corrupt, unelected undemocratic organisation run by a bunch of rabid clowns !!! - and they think leavers are thick!!!
1/1	I would rather just be out.
1/0	I would say for a very simple reason - the UK discriminates against those from outside the EU in favour of those inside. Those earning under ¬£35,000 p/a have been forced to go back to their country of citizenship.  It's unfair that someone without a job can enter the UK whilst a skilled person like yourself (I presume you have a Commonwealth background) has stringent visa requirements. My family migrated to the UK from the Commonwealth, and I feel disappointed that those with similar links would be discriminated against in favour of low-skilled migrants with poor to no proficiency in English.  There are many other more general reasons for voting to leave the EU, such as preserving democracy (instead of handing power to an unelected commission), and the exposure to failing economies in southern Europe. For more information about those, I recommend watching 'Brexit the Movie' on YouTube.
0/1	I would simply like to give a big fuck you to all who voted leave
1/1	I would still VOTE LEAVE
1/1	I would vote leave all over again. Don't listen to these bias networks so fake and corrupt.
1/1	I would vote leave now more than ever, the lies and the people who are involved with the remain. Side make me even more. Enthusiastic to leave
0/0	I wouldn't let this Government run a bath let alone trust them to deal with Brexit properly. Just bin Brexit and get back to normality.
0/0	I wouldn't trust UK politicians to find their way out of a paper bag. Luckily, the economy doesn't rely on them but the Govt has enough influence to screw things up when times are good and worsen them when they're bad.  Brexit will be a long, drawn out, painful and unecessary process which, like all divorces, will benefit lawyers the most! It'll take at least 5 years to complete after which we'll probably wonder why we bothered in the first place because the world is changing anyway due to unrelated factors and completely different reasons.
1/1	I wouldn‚Äôt blow them up. If I ever got into power I‚Äôd give you all ¬£5,000 to ¬£10,000 and ask you to leave. I don‚Äôt believe that Islam should be in the west, no. This is a Christian country
0/0	I wouldn‚Äôt trust a Brexiteer to make me a sandwich.
0/0	I'd give my left testicle to have PM Trump for 8 years instead of Brexit.
1/1	I'd honestly prefere to just leave without a deal and end this charade.
1/1	I'd like to see a detailed account of what we allegedly owe this nest of gangsters before one penny is paid. Justify the ¬£39Bn if you can, Barnier, then our side can put in a counter claim regarding how much the EU owes us as one of the 9 nations which actually pays into the EU budget.
1/1	I'd rather nuke europe than stay in.

1/1	I'll be voting out, democracy and sovereignty are not things the eu takes seriously considering parliament has already practically given our sovereignty away early to Brussels which is illegal, proof of an unwillingness to fight for English common law and the English bill of rights, along with the introduction of mandatory registration of births which is a manufacture of consent to take my child under some cited bureaucracy which missed baby p...  If we save the money we pay the eu and go for a basic income benefit for all Ontop of work, to end wage slavery child poverty, hunger, adult education and entrepreneurial barriers finally and save the job center finding me a job for less than the London living wage anyway, can't unionise, can't go to uni, can't find out when I'm being fired, or why without a tribunal which makes finding work harder next time. Meanwhile we bail out dodgy.financial institutions and.subsidise the rich for looking after their short term profits and.relocating manufacturing abroad paying less tax in the process while my local shopkeeper breaks his back for his wage and would get arrested if he couldn't afford it while those that can pay more early pay less last, our politicians are too disconnected from the power of the people the 97% at least. The eu is relic of a nwo we Need to abandon now n plan much later.. when it includes people like me and you, not a load of terrorists Obama, George and.Blair helped anger supporting wars we knew were illegitimate. Parliament next.
0/0	I'll never for give them - or the idiots that voted for it.

0/0	I'm #voteremain tomorrow because I have two young daughters who I want to have opportunities to work, study and travel freely across Europe
1/1	I'm 18 and I'm voting to leave. The media are making out as if loads of young people want to stay but I know loads of people my age who want to leave- it's not just older people!
1/1	I'm 19 and I voted out I must be a racist and uneducated obviously
0/0	I'm 58 (with a mother who was a child in WW2) and well remember fearing my generation would be pulled into a European war because they happened every generation. But now we're three generations in without a major war in Europe and it's the EU that's done it.
0	I'm 63, voted remain, and hate Brexit with every fibre of my being, in large part because of the impact on my children and their families. Not everyone in their 60s is impervious to the effect on younger people.
1/1	I'm American but I agree with brexit.
1	I'm British ... I voted leave ... and I haven't changed my mind!
0/0	I'm British and i'm voting to stay. the EU needs reform but leaving will be like cutting the nose off in spite of the face. if it doesn't reform it's doomed anyway.
0/0	I'm Portuguese and I know the Portuguese Empire was huge a few centuries ago, just like Britain. But we're in 2019! British people need to set aside their "Nationalism" pride and realize that alone, the EU small countries are no match to nowadays superpowers (USA, Russia and China). Not only did the EU keep all countries in peace for decades, it led to a fast development of all EU members. Of course we lose a very small part of our freedom, but imagine if the USA states all separated... 90% of them would become weak and irrelevant in the world's economy. They are strong because they are together, and we need to work together as Europeans in order to thrive!

1/1	I'm a leaver, but I'm starting to see that a lot of the talk about brexiteers being thick is accurate in a lot of cases. ''We voted out. Just leave, no deal. Leave means leave''..
0/0	I'm a remainer but I think it's wrong to delay Brexit.
0/0	I'm a remainer who would like a second referendum, however I can see a reasonable argument not to have one
0/1	I'm a year late seeing this. Shame it wasn't obligatory viewing in mid-June 2016. We may have avoided the abortion of Brexit. Tragic.
0/0	I'm against Brexit, but the reason is you know, because democracy?¬†You can't just overthrow parliament because you dislike them. Which would also coincidentally lead to actual civil war with the half of the population who voted for Brexit.
0/1	I'm against brexit but a vote is a vote. Brexit was voted and we have to get over it. The day after the vote the discussion should have been how to make brexit better for everyone.
0/0	I'm anti brexit because of the loss of trade and harm it will do to the UK economy. Stuff the racism and xenophobia arguments against leaving.
0/0	I'm ashamed to be british
1/1	I'm considered a millennial and everyone I know voted to leave and we would all do it again.
1/0	I'm for open globalism, not narrow regionalism.

0/0	I'm having a very "lively" dialog with several British friends through social media regarding Brexit, and the mood is clear: an atmosphere of pure fantasy has gripped a sizeable number of people.
1/-1	I'm hoping for economic integration and maybe a resumption of the free movement of people
0/0	I'm in scotland and we voted to stay and we might get it
0/0	I'm just worried that as a resident, the standard of living will go down, prices will go up, I'm worried about the economy, etc.
0/0	I'm laughing so hard at the comments about Britain being British again. LMAO have you seen London? All that new money comes from Nigeria, the Middle-east, Russia and China. Britain needs that money to sustain a healthy economy but yet they want to see immigrants as pests. Well congrats to you all. I'm curious what this is going to look like.
1/1	I'm mid twenties and I voted leave.
1/1	I'm minted and vote Leave. Why would I want to be surrounded by poor people? It makes being rich a bit stressful.
0/0	I'm moving to Canada.
0/-1	I'm no longer proud to be British.
1/1	I'm no political genius but surely there must be more advantages to leaving than remaining, I voted leave but I just cannot understand why there is such an outcry to remain, can someone explain to me why
1/1/1	I'm not English but I support the U.K.'s desire to leave the E.U. because liberal policies screw countries
1/1	I'm not a baby boomer and I voted for Brexit. I find it quite disheartening to see how twisted the reasons for Brexit have become that people believe that leave voters chose to do so based out of spite.
1/1	I'm not angry im really happy that the EU want's a no deal brexit.  That's what we voted for!!!
1/1	I'm not doing this for the UK. I'm doing this for ALL europeans.
0/0	I'm not entirely sure you're going to be able to negotiate a better deal. UK will lose 45% of export, and quite a bit of import from the EU.  If the EU will deny trade with the UK, the UK would jump down a massive economic black hole.  The entire economic viability depends on the willingness of the EU to continue trading after the Brexit. If that's not on the table, the UK will have to be damn sure it can replace all it's EU import and export, by making new trade agreements with its biggest suppliers and consumers of goods. But they'd be doing this at a severe disadvantage.  Some people will say you can use Switzerlands model, or Norways model, but there is no evidence supporting that the EU will allow this. Neither countries were ever in the EU. For the EU it was a win-win situation, and maybe they'll join the EU later on. Trade with the UK after Brexit would still be beneficial for Europe, but it depends on how much the EU would want to make a statement about a member leaving. Europe could economically survive the Brexit (it would still sting for members states), it's difficult to say if the UK would survive it too, if trade with the EU would stop. Losing a tiny bit of export/import is do-able, but 45% of export? I'm not so sure.  I don't even understand how you can consider the possibility of a Brexit till you can address the severe economic uncertainty and can guarantee that the Brexit isn't also an economical exit.
1/1	I'm not from Britain but I agree with the result. You have to cut off from the nipple at some point and it's going to be hard. There will be struggles and trying times but in the end everyone in Britain will reap the benefits. We as Americans struggled for awhile after leaving the British but we became the most powerful country in the world(maybe not so much anymore!). I believe Britain will become a powerhouse after cutting ties to all the countries feeding off them like leeches.
1/1	I'm not going to vote, since I'm a Belgian citizen. I'm a Bruxiter, which is to mean that I want to get rid of the EU. And Brexit is an important step on that way.  I follow the news of several countries but mainly France, the UK, Belgium, Italy, Germany, etc... and I follow several country subreddits and one thing has struck me: it's like everyone is totally disconnected from what is happening elsewhere. It's like everyone is staring at their own navel and not seeing what's happening in the other EU member countries.  When you make the effort to look at the bigger picture, to connect the dots so to speak, I don't understand for the life of me why you would want to stay in the EU. Didn't you see how the EU bullied Greece and is now bullying Italy? Don't you ever read about the German debate about the Euro? Don't you see how impopular Macron has become? Don't you know there have been two referendums in the Netherlands, one concerning the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 and more recently one on the association agreement between the EU and the Ukraine, twice the Dutch voted no, twice their political class wiped their asses with the result?  I mean, when you look at the bigger picture, how can you not conclude that what's happening now in the UK is the exact same scenario that has been played over and over again in Europe the past 30 years? But maybe that's exactly the problem, you don't look at the bigger picture.
1/1	I'm not interested in seeing EU fail. I'm just not interested in Britain being a part of it any more.
0/0	I'm not pro-Brexit, if that's what you mean
1/1	I'm not saying businesses are bad, we NEED businesses and traid. I just don't want BP passing legislations for us. The UK used to produce a lot of stuff so we exported loads, now we import more then we sell. Outside the EU, we'd have better trading prospects, It won't be free traid, But there will be more options.
0/0	I'm not so sure they are. Sure, there will be some of those in there, but I think for many people, they have no idea of or care for how the country's finances work, where the money comes from that pays for their beloved NHS, police, defence etc - they just think it grows on a tree and/or "the rich" will pay. Hence labour's appeal.
1/1	I'm not white, and I'm 19. I voted leave. It's not about remembering tyranny. It's about appreciating freedom.
0/0	I'm pretty sure everyone in the union is getting their services etc at a much cheaper rate than compared to other countries who have to maintain their own agencies for those services. So in a sense we are all getting more out if than if we were to go at it solo. That is all that matters in the end. You have to provide those services anyways.  It's hard to put all this in numbers to show what the actual return is so it often gets overlooked I feel.
0/0	I'm pretty sure we made the wrong decision
0/0	I'm pretty sure we made the wrong decision.
1/1	I'm pro-Europe. I'm just anti-Brussels.
0/0	I'm probably just gonna move to a different country... Oh wait they wouldn't want my dumb British arse
1/1	I'm rather sure the US, Canada, Australia, and Singapore would also enter into very favorable trade agreements with the UK in the event of a Clean Brexit. Taken together, this is a much larger trading pool than the EU. And a better one as well.
1/0	I'm sad by Brexit like Spanish, but I can understand Britons: pay EU budget for the South Europeans countries and also receive massive immigration: Is not a good issue. EU were not good formed:the buildings begin at bottom, not at the top. Farewell.
1/1	I'm sick of Anti-brexit articles being pushed by the Biased Broadcasting Corporation at every opportunity.
1/1	I'm sick of remainers. I initially voted remain (Only to avoid a higher cost of living, even if it's only for a few years) but I respect democracy and I now want to leave. No matter the margin, whether it's 1 vote or 3 million. The EU is corrupt and we need to leave for our independence. Tyranny shall lose. We can survive, albeit with short term extreme difficulty. Big riots will happen if not.
0/0	I'm so ashamed of my fellow countrymen!
0/0	I'm so glad I'm not British. In truth, Britain is too weak and workshy to not be a European puppet state. They should accept their status and beg the EU to take them back. They will not be able to survive in the big wide world.
1/0/1	I'm so glad we finally got rid of those stubborn idiots. I hope they are not gonna revoke their decision.
1/1	I'm so glad we're leaving
0/1/0/0/0	I'm so incredibly sad about this. As a part of the younger generation in the UK I'm terrified for what the future could hold for us. I can't believe this happened.
1/1	I'm so proud of all my followers who have put country first and #voted to #Leave the rotten EU. I'm off to do my bit shortly - back later!
1/1	I'm so proud of my fellow Britons. We voted to get our country back but will we? It's now a waiting game to see when Article 50 is triggered, soon hopefully. I've got no regrets about voting 'Out' and will do again if they try to stitch is up.
1/1	I'm so proud that we all voted for British Sovereignty
1/1	I'm sorry but the EU is no longer just 6 countries as they said here. There are 27 countres, but the main 6 or even main 2 (Germany and France) are behaving like the rest of the EU is their property. If this will still be as it is now there will be more quits from EU.
1/1	I'm starting to think a 'Brexit' is a good idea and I never thought I'd ever say that.
0/0	I'm stockpilling. I don't trust this government, they've been quite incompetent so far.
0/0	I'm sure that the A50 revocation aka "please take me back, I'll behave" letter is already drafted, ready to be sent to Brussels days before March 29.
0/0	I'm voting IN, because the UK can't fight climate change on its own. Why are you IN? #strongerin #eureferendum
1/1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry.
1/1	I'm voting OUT. Europe is full of weak, poor and struggling countries. How can joining them be a good thing for us? I wish it were just France, Germany and UK in EU, now that would be a decent alliance and I'd be in.
0/0	I'm voting to remain because what they have done to are fishing industry...Oh and for mobile roaming charges
0/0	I'm voting to remain.

0/0	I'm voting to stay in the EU. These heroes you list. They're all from a different era. If you compare modern Britain to the Britain they lived in we are have fallen behind. We don't have any innovators. All we have are idiots like Cameron and Farrage and Co. Those heroes had a high degree of selflessness and humanity, which is lacking in today's leaders. Churchill and the rest weren't perfect, but their like have gone and won't be seen again. People who think we are still like those heroes are living in a fantasy world.

1/1	I'm with them, but think we are headed for no Brexit and some real anger from the 17.4-million, it's a stitch up, the greatest betrayal of all time.
0/0	I'm worried about the prospect of a Micheal Gove, Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith, Daniel Hannan and possibly Nigel Farage government being elected if we leave. That would be a disaster of epic proportions!
0/0	I've already had the most precious of gifts from Brexit - realising my parents are racists. They kept it hidden for a long time but thanks to Brexit, it's been pulled out into the sun. They alienated almost all of their kids and grandkids with their political rants on Facebook, it's been really hard to deal with. You think that someone is kind, generous and fair but then it turns out that it only applies to British people, preferably not Irish, and definitely not Romanians or Poles. Thanks Brexit!
0/0	I've always voted labour and I'm an ex trade union official but I will never vote labour again unless they try and stop brexit.
1/1	I've been clear that Brexit means Brexit.
0/0	I've been feeling rather ashamed of my own country for quite some time now
1/1	I've lived my early life in a Communist country, a former Soviet republic and I notice a hell of a lot of parallels with the EU today. The EU seems to think that modern communism is the answer. Taking money from "rich" countries and redistributing it to the "poor" countries. I for one do not relish the idea of paying for poor Romanians (yes I'm evil I hate moochers, I don't care if they're poor I don't want my money going to help them I want it to help my own countrymen), or the billions that Poland gets (incidentally Poland is not a poor country yet receives shit-tons of money from the EU for some reason despite having better infrastructure than most member states) and then you have to accept foreign workers that work for less money and put you out of a job (yeah don't tell me it doesn't happen or that we don't want dem jobs etc).  The USSR was one giant country. The EU is quite close to that definition and the way that some people in here and /r/europe talk it seems they want this as well. They want to erase their national identity. They want their money taken from them and handed over to French farmers who don't do anything, or to make Poland better while other member states roads and infrastructure crumble due to lack of investment.  Why does anyone want a federal state? Why does anyone want to erase national identity? Why does anyone want to take on millions of economic migrants (yes, they aren't refugees - [even the EU said so] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-out-of-10-migrants-to-europe-come-for-economic-reasons-and-are-not-refugees-eu-vice-president-a6836306.html) so please explain pro-eu people why you want this ? Why do you want a federal state ? do you think it would be better than your own government ?  Why do you want a drunk as your leader? Who spends thousands on expensive wines and slaps people in the face while he's drunk ?  Why do you want your wealth redistributed to supposedly "poor" countries? Why do you want everyone to use the same dodgy currency that constantly needs bailing out ? Why do you want protectionism that means you end up paying more for stuff just so a bunch of Germans get to keep selling you appliances that break down in 2 years?  I'm proud to now be a British citizen, and I'm proud to be a brexiter as well. I have three degrees and I'm not stupid and I'm not racist or xenophobic either. Why must remainers label everyone as such ? It's a straw man right ?  I don't get it.
0	I've never seen or met a brexiteer that doesn't seem... off..
1/1	I've said it before and I'll say it again! The EU are scared to death of us leaving them and that's why they're being such a pain. Get up, walk out and loads of other countries will then follow. They haven't got the bottle to do it themselves but will do it after we've done all the hard work. About time you got tough TM but at last you are doing something!
0	I've seen how the EU tackles tax evasion versus the US ‚Äì and if Brexit Britain follows Trump, we're headed for disaster
0/0	I've spoken to a hell of a lot of Brexit supporters and have yet to hear a single well thought out and reasonable argument about the benefits of leaving the EU. So far I have seen only ignorance, arrogance or bigotry from them. What we're going to lose and the struggle we'll all now face with higher taxes, fewer job opportunities, expensive holidays and inevitable increases to the cost of living, are not worth the risk. We've just sold our democracy to the Tories, who were already on their way to destroying it and now can complete their task.
0/0	I+B69 can't believe the idiocy of this argument, that recession, slow growth, ineffective monetary policy and beaten down banks have been around for so long that they could not have anything to do with Brexit. You are like a doctor saying to the heart attack patient that your heart block is not because of your heart attack, because both heart attacks and cholesterol in your arteries have been around for a long time. The logic is so stupid I cannot find words to express the sheer ignorance of it. THE ECONOMY IS CYCLICAL, PROBLEMS GET BETTER AND WORSE ACCORDING TO ECONOMIC DECISIONS AND BEHAVIOUR. WHAT IS IN QUESTION WITH BREXIT IS CAUSATION OF THE SINGLE INSTANCE OR TREND RELATED TO THESE ISSUES AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

0/0	Idiocracy is ensuing. People who knew jackshit about the complexity of how the world runs were given a say in the matters they knew nothing about. Moreover, they will label anyone who's trying to feed information to their empty heads as having an agenda. Direct democracy is a form of mob rule where the mob will do everything which "feels" right rather than what the reality at hand indicates.
1/1	Idiots, I voted for Brexit. Strange how people can't deal with reality without fitting everything into narratives, it shows ignorance in their worldview

0/0	If Brexit happens, it will be a disaster.
0/0	If Brexit is not carried out only people who believe immigration causes all our problems and rich unaffected by Brexit people should riot, good honest caring people would be celebrating if we remain.
0/0	If Brexit is so great why are there no Brexit leaders willing to lead. It's seems they all know it would be the end of their political careers if they had to be PM during a hard exit...ergo,May is still in power.
1/1	If Brexit means an extra ¬£10-12 a month on my ¬£100 shopping bill, it's worth it as long as we get out of Europe. They don't care about us.
0/0	If Brexit wins, having a dual-nationality will come in handy.
1/1	If Brit has to choose between EU and an active volcano, it sould choose active volcano. EU is pure sh**
0/0	If Britain leaves the EU then Scotland should do another referundum on leaving Britain
0/0	If Britain leaves the EU, it will sink like an anchor. Because of borders, Northern Ireland will likely vote to leave the UK and rejoin Ireland, Scotland may vote again to leave the UK too and rejoin the EU.
1/0	If Britain leaves the European Union, then it will make Europe more solitary and confined and will begin a domino effect where one EU member leaves an another states leave too. This will bring Europe back to World War I. In addition Europe won't be the same again, but the benefit are that. Since Turkey want to join the EU. Now they can't, this mean a revival of the native European culture and identity. Leading to the end of Multi-cultural ism and deportation of immigrant and migrants.
1/1	If Britain leaving weakens the German Empire, then Russia is pleased. But that is not a bad thing - the German Empire antagonising Russia is dangerous and perhaps an internally weak EU would be less aggressive. Either way, it would be better for us to not be entangled in such things.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, She must choose the open sea!
1/1	If Britain so badly needed skilled workers, why would the workers have to be immigrants
1/1	If Cameron is unable to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership under the EU, I fear I may have do the previously unthinkable and vote for a Brexit.
1/1	If England is smart, they will send 20,000 troops into Scotland to dissuade them from the Independence referendum. Britain must act the part of an Empire again.
1/1	If England should chose between Europe and the High seas she should always chose the high seas a quote from Winston Churchill weal always bounce back because were English it's what we do
0/0	If England wanted a say to what happens in Europe they lost it now. Like Oliver's point here, if they hate the EU they'd be better off having a seat at the EU decision maker's table and not leaving all of Europe to be decided by the French and the Germans. They'd be fools to think what happens in Europe won't effect them in Britian.
0/0	If England won't take the refuges. Ireland will. We will take as many as we can.  Disgraceful behaviour England.  Just ridiculous. To the people who thought of only themselves  Inhuman to have torn and broken people to leave.
1/1	If European countries have any sense they will all be voting for their own exits, before Brussels eradicates the indigenous populations with Arficans and Muslims from the 3rd world.
0/0	If I remember my History wasn't it Churchill who encouraged and recommended a United Europe with a United army?
1/1	If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU,I'd vote to stay in.But there isn't.Sad.Sorry,Paddy.
0/0	If I vote remain tomorrow, and Britain stays in an increasingly authoritarian EU, I can just about live with myself. If I vote leave tomorrow, and Britain becomes even more of a Tory dystopia without the EU, I don‚Äôt think I can live with myself. So, for that reason, I‚Äôm sticking with remain.
1/1	If I wasn't a Brexiteer before watching #InsideEurope I would be after watching it. Without exception, the EU leaders come across as arrogant, bullying, and scornful of Britain.
0/0	If James Bond says remain, who are we to disagree! #StrongerIn #VoteRemain
0/0	If May cared about Britain she would so the right thing and put the question back to us in a People's Vote. Jeremy should stop associating with and enabling her. She is as toxic as Brexit itself.
0/1	If May takes the country down the no deal route she will lose and she will reconfigure the parties in parliament permanently.
0/0	If UK wants to stay in a premier world league VOTE REMAIN. If the UK wants to shrink to a minor league with an OAP ruler practicing medieval ways . then VOTE LEAVE. .....AS for "Rule Britannia" .. there will be nothing to rule. But like the British Empire Ur ship is sinking. Does Ur OAP ruler care ??. not one bit .She has said and done nothing .. go racing at Ascot .YES
1/1	If a Brexit brings about the end of the EU as we know it ,so much the better for all 300 million plus European citizens.
0/0	If a leadership or coach (UK government) of football team is bad you don't step out the competition(EU)! You must kick out the management but not step out of the competition(EU) or breakup the team(UK). The UK people has turned her anger against themselves instated of the people that harm your county.
0/0	If a no deal `hard‚Äô Brexit is coming, then the only good thing we can look forward to is the permanent destruction of the Conservative & Unionist Party.
1/1	If a second referendum is called i will vote leave again, but only so the remainers don't win but then im finished ever voting again because there would be little point if there is no democracy and any vote i win called be asked to do it again and again.
1/1	If all negotiations and decisions in the EU involve this kind of bluff, bluster and brinkmanship, I think membership sounds like a nightmare, and we had better leave. What a horrible 'club'!
1/1	If all negotiations and decisions in the EU involve this kind of bluff, bluster and¬†brinkmanship,¬†I think membership sounds like a nightmare, and we had better leave. What a horrible 'club'!
1/-1	If all the snowflakes did this we could change the course of our future and get a hard working class of people that are patriotic .
0/0	If anyone calls this Independence Day I will kick you in the teeth with the strength of all the countries the British empire colonised
0/0	If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy
0/0	If every single Remainer in London could spare 15 minutes outside parliament with us it would be formidable! #NoBrexit #RevokeA50 let's be sensible and not destroy our country #Remain!
0/0	If everyone spoke the truth and listend to i. Then things would have been different. Worst thing in brexit is the murder of a politician and a journalist.
1/1	If feels like working for a horrible boss and being giving the opportunity to go self employed...you‚Äôd be scared at first but an amazing chance to be happy and more successful
1/1	If in doubt, vote out
0/0	If it ain't broke don't Brexit.
1/1	If it does nothing else, this encapsulates all the reasons why we must leave on March 29th. A more malign and malevolent group of European¬† bureaucrats¬† would be very hard to imagine. Beyond our departure date, how will any British negotiator be able to view such people with anything other than extreme revulsion.
1/0	If it is true then the British government should not allow them to come back when the EU collapses but I doubt any successful company would want to join a sinking ship!!!!
1/1	If it means we can go back to using decent lightbulbs and choose high-powered hairdryers and vacuum cleaners if we so wish, I'm joining Brexit for sure
1/1	If it's a No Deal Brexit it can only be the remainers rioting cos all the leavers will be partying lol.
0/0	If it's not about money, why do brexiters still hide behind 'project fear' with the announcement of every valid economic warning ? The truth is that leave voters aren't prepared to pay the true cost of brexit and never have been.
1/1	If its this hard to leave now it will be impossible to leave in the future, once thats the case we will have lost our sovereignty. Time to leave now.
1/-1	If leaving the EU would be so devestating why are we giving a referendum?
0/0	If manufacturing companies knew they would have to pay heavy import duties they might think twice about Brexit.
0/0	If no deal means turning everything upside down as would happen with Brexit, then it's not better, it's tragic.
1/1/1	If one thing has come out of Brexit it is that the younger generation and their supporters like me really have a chance to make it work as a system.
1/1	If only eu doesn‚Äôt have that stupid free movement and refugee law
0/0	If only we could forget brexit, then it could be the gift that keeps on giving money and human rights
1/1	If over 350,000 is the net increase in the population can some one tell me how many British skilled people left Britain and how Many unskilled people arrive in Britain, because going on statistics the Government gives out it is closer to one Million unskilled people arriving in Britain every year. VOTE TO LEAVE
1/1	If people didn't bother to vote when they had the opportunity, tough
0/1	If politicians faced criminal prosecution for fraud, etc., instead of being protected by Parliament, would we be in this mess? Surely Brexit would have been binned by now.
1/1	If the EU don't want to deal respect their decision and look to others who do stop wasting time close the door and open another one just walk away.
1/1	If the EU drained the swamp, brought in more democratic decision making, and barred leaders of countries allowing in mass migration, then I would vote to remain or stop Brexit.
1/0	If the EU heads towards a single state national identity will be lost as new laws reflect the views of europe and not individual coutries and the interests of the UK people are put second to the interests of the EU. A law institued in Germany might have totally different implications when instituted in the uk because they are culturally and economically different. A one size fits all policy doesn't work on region as diverse as europe.  Intergration may be ok if it happened from the bottom up with the UK people pushing for greater unity but it isn't. It is happening from the top down and is being impossed on the UK people whether they like it or not.
0/0	If the EU is so bad then how come only a tiny minority of our parliment wants to vote leave?
1/1	If the EU refuses to renegotiate or even discuss amendments to the backstop, then that proves that the Eurosceptics were correct and that the backstop was designed to keep the UK locked into the EU forever. They don't want us to leave because too many EU jobs depend on the UK. They also need our contributions to keep the Eastern Block happy spending our money. They can also use our money to build their Super state. Let Juncker, Macron, Merkel and Tusk explain to the rest of the EU why their intransigence has cost the ¬£39 Billion. That is a hell of a price to 'punish' the UK!
0/0	If the UK actually leaves the EU, then it‚Äôs going to take longer than a decade for any kind of trust to be re-established, if ever. So re-admittance at any level will take several decades to achieve.
1/1	If the UK does not leave the EU, it will demonstrate democracy in the UK and the EU is a farce, it's fake, an illusion, no better than North Korea !
1/1	If the UK goes back to its old ties, a CANZUK trading block would be able to hold its own with the other global superpowers.
0/0	If the UK leaves the EU, Northern Ireland will leave the Union of the UK for Ireland and Scotland becomes independent. The UK will cease to exist, all that will remain is England+Wales.
0/0	If the UK leaves without a deal and in essence renege on its good friday agreement commitments, an international treaty, who on earth is going to trade deals with the UK?
1/1	If the UK wasn't stripped of assets and industry being sold off we would of kept our independence. The country has turned into a free for all camp site for everyone around the world. It's not been respected nor treated and looked after like a home. The new breed of soft headed snowflakes have crippled the country. Mainly because less important things have been made a priority. Bring back tradition culture and disapline and make it a democracy again. We the people/tax payer tell you what to do. The government isn't to tell us what to do, we elect them we pay for them we own them. They should respect the English and their home. We don't go to other countries and do what they do yo us, they wouldn't tolerate it. It's all a mess and people in power DON'T have the best interests at heart. So this country WILL go down because corruption WON'T allow good to prevail. I'm English and my country is being turned into a world gateway and a business hub for other countries. My country is being stolen and given away. All those who died for our country and now it's for what????????? DISGUSTING AND SHAMEFULL our leaders should pay a penalty considering they don't hesitate to make the tax payer pay. It's treason it's betrayal it's deception. England should be England just like each other country should be it's own. After that we should continue to trade and work together. Simple without greed. News reporters and channels should give the truth but even you guys are bought, corrupt puppets being told what to do. So really there is no hope because your all full off utter shite and lies. People shall rise and wars shall happen. People will die and suffer all because the fat gits at the top don't care whilst hiding behind closed doors
1/0	If the UK were ever to leave the EU, it will be an impoverished *England* that, in a not so distant future, will be back, asking to be let in again. ON ITS KNEES.
1/1	If the hard brexit happened northern Ireland might get freed and so might Scotland
1	If the two main political parties fail to deliver the Brexit we voted they will destroy themselves, I have repeatedly emailed my local MP and TM to say that I will not vote for them again if they fail to deliver the will of the majority of eligible voters which was to leave, deals were not on the ballot paper just leave or remain.
1/1	If the uk leaves eu it will be pure bliss and brilliant for all uk citizens
1	If there is any truth in that the Government are preparing to keep us in the Customs Union in order to save PMs deal. I will certainly vote against it. How can this be taking back contro
0/0	If there was a second referendum, and the result was still to leave, that would be the winner for mass stupidity of the century, second to venezuela.
1/1	If there was to be a second referendum, then it would be a betrayal of democracy. Just cause you didn't get the result you wanted, doesn't mean you can cry and want another till you get what you want.
1/1/1	If these REMOANERS would negotiate half as hard with EU like they do against LABOUR and BREXITEERS the UK would be in better shape.
1/1	If these foreigners worry so much about a 'No deal' and Britain's economy, then why are they so demanding and rigid in their negotiations with us. It doesn't add up does it?
1/1	If these people love the EU so much then go live in Europe..problem solved..bye
0/0	If they cared about what is right for the country they wouldnt be backing Brexit
0/0	If they wanted to sort immigration out why have they done nothing about non-EU immigration the last 2 years?
0/0	If this is true, Brexit should be canceled and abolished right now.
1/1	If this woman doesn't understand why it is that people voted for Brexit....then prehaps she should look in the mirror. A complete "let them eat cake" attitude.
1/1	If we are charitable, we could put this down to the EU's incomplete command of the English language. If not, it is yet another instance of their complete disregard and disrespect for us. The fact they don't seem to want to change it implies the latter ....
1/1	If we deny the people the opportunity to leave on 29th March, they‚Äôll never forgive us.
0/0	If we do end up leaving (I'm still hopeful a second referendum will come) I can't wait to see what / who / how middle England blames all their problems on going forward. It's been forginers and the EU for decades, soon these bigoted pricks will have nobody else to blame except the government who have screwed them for decades. Shame they couldn't see that before we voted.
1/1	If we don't get out now we will never get out ever again. When everyone realises that staying was the wrong decision, it'll be too late.
1/1	If we don't leave the EU, it will only be a matter of time before it's businessmen-politicians in Brussels, who are only in it for the money and power, will be the ones sending our troops off to war.
1/1	If we don't leave the EU, we should sack all the MP,s and the Lord's, they are no longer needed. The EU now makes all our laws so the MP,s are taking money on false pretenses. Aso we are now a rubbish dump for all the world's unemployables and gangster,s
1/1	If we don‚Äôt get out then it‚Äôs plan B: tear it up from the inside.
1/1	If we fail to leave I fear the country will move to the right.
0/-1	If we go over the cliff, it will be the media's fault for giving the jingistic twats a platform. Shamefull.
1/1	If we had had the right people in charge, instead of the craven bunch we did have we could have had this position sorted, done and dusted by now!
1/1	If we leave on WTO they will soon come running to do a good deal. Yes we will suffer some short term pain but it will be worth it
1/1/1	If we leave the EU we won't have to take the migrants that come in off the coast. Things will get more expensive which is good for the UK as we can earn a substantial amount of profit from things such as potatoes. Council taxes will be abolished and laws will become stricter, allowing the UK to have more power over itself. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE
0/0	If we leave the EU, I am moving to Mars.
1/1	If we leave the EU, and eventually we realise it was a bad idea we will be able to rejoin. If we stay in, we will stay in until we are eventually annexed into the United States of Europe.

1/0	If we leave with no deal brexit , fantastic manovering . Good job üôÇ Leave still tethered to eu hang your head in shame and go üò°
1/1	If we leave without a deal the EU will be responsible for the border in Ireland.
0/1	If we left the European Union with no deal there would be disruption to our trade, there would be disruption to European trade as well, it wouldn‚Äôt be in our best interests to do that. Of course it‚Äôs survivable but we don‚Äôt want to be putting our economy into a position of unnecessary turmoil. It wouldn‚Äôt be in our best interests to do that.
1/1	If we really do leave without a deal, the Brussels will lose the 39 billion quid at a stroke. The EU seems to think it can play hardball with us while we are expected to behave like gentlemen.
0/0	If we remain in the EU they'll unblock putlocker and add new shows on to Netflix #Voteremain
1/1	If we remain in the European Union,then the UK‚Äôs relationship with democracy is over!
1/1	If we stay in the EU and our economy grows, our contribution to the EU coffers will grow too. Therefore leaving the EU will allow the UK to grow and reinvest in our own country.
1/1	If we stay in... Forget about pensions ! Forget about the NHS ! With so many people on low wages there will be insufficient tax receipts. Our cherished system will be broken up and sold under the TTIP and practically everything will be privatised. The UK will become a broken two-tier state with the haves and the have-not, those that receive medical care through insurances and those that don't. We need to protect our economic and democratic rights as citizens. Vote OUT !
0/0	If we truly voted Brexit why are you so scared of a second referendum?
0/0	If we vote for Brexit it will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed, relocated or downsized.?
1/1	If we vote to stay in the EU, we will be effectively voting away our very right to vote!
1/1	If we'd done that... we'd have an 80/20 outcome -- favouring CLEAN BREAK BREXIT.

1/1	If you had to pay 80% of your income to a government that does nothing to fix crumbling hospitals, gives out early retirement pensions to 45 year olds, and tries to hire as many people to the public sector as possible to secure votes, wouldn't you try to avoid paying taxes also? This is the case in Greece my friends..

1/1/1	If you look for excuses like nationalism then you will never understand why we voted for Brexit. It was a vote for DEMOCRACY.
0/0	If you love chaos, leaving the European union is the plan.
0/1	If you perpetually sack Remainers and retain Brexiters in the Shadow Cabinet @jeremycorbyn there are conclusions to be drawn: You want Brexit. You will sacrifice the members, Party Policy and Party Conference to get it. You welcome those with your views and sack those without.
0/0	If you think brexit will help workers you should resign your professorship Mark, you are right on a lot of things but not this for the UK.
1/0	If you think the British economy is going to flourish after a no deal, seek professional help
0/0	If you vote out, you're literally no better than a neo-n a z i.
1/1	If you voted remain your a traitor to your country and traitor to your people. If you love Europe so much go live there because I am not European I am British and will be governed by a foreign power.

1/1	Immigrants arriving in Britain from the EU outnumbered Brits heading the other way by a 180,000 in 2016, placing unacceptable strains on housing, welfare and education.
1	Immigrants landing on our beaches in boats, European organised crime operating in the UK already due to open border, jails packed with foreign criminals and the government is all of a sudden concerned.
1/1	Immigration. Needs to be stopped altogether. We are bursting at the seams to many have been let in. From January 2015 till now waiting list for doctors appointments. At my GPS surgery waiting time what once once 2 week wait is now 6 to 7 weeks. And when Turks get in it be even worser. We really do need OUT of the EU otherwise I can see that due to this overcrowding they will be lives at stake. But Cameron. Oblivious to all this he lives in a completely. Different world than us .. He destroying our country. PLEASE VOTE LEAVE .. Before its gets any worser
0	Import duty can be increased up to 10 % from 0% depending on the tariff codes
0/0	Important: Brexit's biggest disadvantage is that it's slowing the U.K.'s economic growth
0/1	Impose fines, big ones by all means, but it stands under British law that the result of an illegally campaigned election can not stand... and yet here we are staring down the barrel of March 29th.. I believe the electoral commissions ruling on the legality of the 2016 result is due some time in late spring..

0/0	In 5 -10 years time when the U.K. tanks we still won't admit Brexit was a bad idea. Ps Trump lol
0/0	In Brexit wonderland, the clearer something is, the more unsayable it becomes. The need to delay article 50 is obvious True! But it would be much better to cancel the whole 'shitshow' completely, and stay in the EU, wouldn't it?
0/0	In a no-deal Brexit, Britain could also lose the continued access it has negotiated to European plane travel records and databases of vehicle registrations, fingerprints and DNA profiles. This is very bad.
1/-1	In any event, it is unclear what Cameron hopes to gain from a vote when he could get his way by simply throwing Britain's weight around;
1/1	In fact go watch Brexit the movie I can't be arsed explaining in full how the EU has turned its back on the UK but still expects us to lube up an take a shafting every time another failing EU economy needs a bailout to the tune of billions.

0/0	In my opinion brexit is a lose-lose situation for everyone. ...
1/1	In my opinion we all might take a hit at first.   But Brexit is a process and the mistake is to assume things won't get better in the long run. In the long run, it's my belief that our economy will improve significantly.
1/1	In my opinion, British will exit the EU. British are very pompous and arrogant people
1/1	In one sense it's awful, but in another, Britain needs to learn a little humility. We are a titchy country, not an imperialist power. It's time we behaved like it. Brexit will enable that.
0/0	In so many ways cursed Brexit is causing this country immense damage right now, and why? To uphold the self congratulatory delusions of grandeur of a small gang of low grade MPs. (You know who they are.)
0/0	In terms of labor mobility, being out of the EU is not as good as being in and there might be a few other issues.
1/1	In the European Union, individual countries are not a problem, but the communist authorities :(
0/0	In the absence of an opposition worthy of the name it is absolutely crucial that papers like the Guardian hold this government to account. Brexit has given them carte blanche to do whatever they want and so far theyve been allowed to get away with it
1/1	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price.
1/1	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price. But they don't pay tax, mortgage, run families and cars and bills etc... they eat poorly and live badly so don't need the income to meet UK expected standards of living.
0/0	In the event we leave the EU and our economy and employment suffers we should sue those who ignored advice and drove us into a severe crisis
1/1	In the long run Brexit gonna be good, be part and have to pay for other peoples bills gonna take germany economi down woth to much wellfair for to little people actualy working
1/0	In today‚Äôs uncertain world we need that shared strength more than ever
0/0	In two years Theresa May has attended to the needs of only one group - the far-right hard Brexiteers like Johnson and Rees-Mogg. She has ignored all the rest - the 16 million who voted Remain, the millions who did not vote, the upcoming next generations and even the moderates in her own party. Is the survival of the Tory Party so much more important than the survival of the country? If the worst prime minister of any country in history had ever had a proper job, like, for example, that of a primary school teacher, then she would know that the easiest way to draw attention to yourself is to be a nuisance. Farage and UKIP were a nuisance - but small and ignorable until their tactics were copied by Rees-Mogg‚Äôs foul group, who learnt how to be nuisances themselves. Theresa May has shown herself to be just too weak, too stupid and too incompetent to slap down these unpatriotic, destructive nuisances. They have had her total attention, instead of being made to stand in the Naughty Corner.
1/1	In war time we got supplies into the country as U Boats were sinking our shipping. We voted LEAVE and whatever that brings. LEAVE NOW.
0/0	Incredible to read the mind boggling stupidity of the Brexiters. The UK will leave without honouring its commitments and the world is going to rush to our door for the chance to trade ..... this is beyond stupid.
0/1/0	Incredibly passionate speech from Sheila Hancock, on why we‚Äôre stronger together than apart #VoteRemain:
0/0	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic
0/0/0	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic, and would gladly see European countries develop an alternative and leave the EU behind.
0/0	Indeed, forget the Leaver doom and gloom, the prospects for the EU remains bright.
1/1	Independence day 29th march WTO terms
1/1	Independence is the only way
0/-1	Inexcusable for any Labour MP to take a bung from May. If funds are available why is her gov not using them already? The northern towns were pillaged by Thatcher years ago, not the EU. Their reps should discuss that.
1/1	Initially would be teething problems. Long term will be positive imo.
1/1	Instead of trading and cooperating with the other parts of the world, Europe wanted to close its doors on itself. Now, it is losing its members due to economical issues ... and I think Britain's exit is just a start .
1/0	Interesting Opinion. I still feel open migration is a threat to all decent society and a significant cause of all our troubles. Even visa overstays threaten any nation. We are¬†not¬†one world or one people. England must be free of encumbrances. England must stay English, same principles for the Dutch and French.
1/0	Interesting behavior - don't like results , find collusion
1/0	Interesting how all the rich people want us to #VoteRemain but the man on the street wants to #VoteLeave......ü§î Sums it up I think! #Brexit
0/0	Interestingly, Brexitons rarely claim that they "won" fair and square. They merely bleat, incorrectly, that the Remain campaign also lied and overspent - in other words, "We cheated better than you." And they call that democracy.
0/0	International banks and companies are already relocating their businesses to the EU, although it is not yet clear that there is a hard Brexit. Once the no deal brexit is determined, most international companies will leave your misty island and leave hundreds of thousands unemployed.¬†Brexiteers and thousands of trolls he pays to spread nonsense are Putin's useful idiots in destabilising Western democracies - first UK.
0/0	Invades half of the world and now has problems with immigrants.....
1/0	Ireland says we got to this deal after two years of negotiations..no we didn't. The EU didn't negotiate for months until they got our assurance of gettimg our money. Merkel refused to discuss EU citizens rights until then. So the EU are not innocent on this, they wasted time.
0/0	Ireland will receive copious EU backhanders and so will not be crucified. Germany will now sell more cars to Japan, Canada & British Bankers relocated to Frankfurt. In fact replacing UK models with EU/Canada/Japan compliant models will increase profits per vehicle As has been said before, EU will catch the common cold, UK will catch double pneumonia
0/0	Ironically London has to deal with the most immigration for the longest time and they voted to stay. So yes rest of England you are blaming all your problems on immigrants. They aren't taking your jobs. Jobs are being affected by a recession that England has only just come out of. Your solution was to exit the single market and put us back into it. I'm glad I moved to Asia and hope never to return.
0/0	Is Airbus a threat? Is JLR a threat? Is Barclays a threat? Is Dyson a threat? Is EMA loss a threat? Is the @The_IoD known for lying? The relentless ignorance of you & Leavers is astonishing.
0/0	Is anyone sorting out another anti-brexit march? We need to get out into the streets of London again!
1/0	Is going to take away your sovereignty, democracy, own constitution, laws, army, basically every notion of who you are.
0/0	Is it just me or are all the leave voters OAPs or people teens who do not know the repercussions of leaving?
0/0	Is it this simple? May can‚Äôt blame the disaster on the people who caused the disaster because it would finish the party. So she‚Äôs conspiring with the people who caused the disaster to blame the disaster on the EU, secure in the support of media which helped cause the disaster.
0/0	Is it time for a "told you so" comment yet or are brexiteers still too occupied with the happy thoughts of no foreigners and blue passports.....
1/0	Is the European Union bad for Europe? Sure, just take a look at European history before the creation of the EU: Things were so better back then
0/0	Is the vote of 2016 of ill informed people valid? NOW people are informed of what Brexit, its consequences and options mean.
0/0	Is there not a TINY part of you, oh great architects of #Brexit, that thinks you just might have got this horribly wrong, that you might prove to be responsible for unprecedented misery and the sad demise of a country that, until you got your hands on it, was a force in Europe?
0/0	Is there still HOPE for UK to stay in the EU
1/-1	Is this supposed to be a 'gotcha' moment. They voted on brexit and they want to get out of this steaming pile of shit called the EU. No one is begging to be let back in, this is just bullshit propaganda.
1/1	Islam has a lot of hate and intolerance in it. No reason for the UK to instead pretend to love and tolerate it. Step 1 is Brexit. I hope they get their country back.
1/-1	Isn't plotting against the Government a treasonable offence?
0/-1	Isn't the speeker of the house ment to be neutral?? Look like he's in labour pocket and a remainer??
0/0	Isolation never works
0/0	It Is Sad That They Leave The EU, But It Is Their Own Decision.
0/0	It all ends in no deal and bad relations with the eu and Ireland.
1/1	It allows the UK economy to remake itself into a much more ¬ìUSA style¬î
1/0	It amuses me that you seriously think we're afraid of leaving. Very funny. Good one.
0/0	It baffles me how people can support what happened. Look at how much the value of the british pound dropped already. Look at all this trade that suffers. Is that really worth making the lives of immigrants harder? I dont think so. Britain's people chose xenophobia over their own interests.
1/1	It better be at 23:00 on the 29th of March 2019 as promised by Theresa May. I want to wake up on the morning of the 30th March 2019 living in a free democratic country once again. NO more being controlled by those unelected eu bureaucrats we had for 47 years. That day will be OUR independence day!!
1/1	It didn't have to be this way; but the EU has now turned into a cult, supported by brainwashed acolytes who refuse to see what is happening. Their compound is rapidly being surrounded, yet their unelected leaders continue to convince them that all is well. The 29 March cannot come soon enough!
0/1	It does seem that the best policy would be to remain in the EU and address the issues that made people vote leave, but what were those issues? I have been trying to analyse why so many people did vote leave and still support leave despite all the new information about the consequences of Brexit. It is not about money as it is generally accepted that nearly everybody in the UK will be financially worse off as a result of Brexit and would be much worse off with the no-deal scenario that many people support. The less well off will be the hardest hit financially. It is not about trade deals. If we leave the Customs Union we will lose 80 trade deals that we already have and benefit from as a member of the EU. It is not about immigration from the EU. Last year net immigration from the EU was 74,000 and falling while immigration from outside the EU was 248,000 and rising. It is not about preserving our culture. Immigrants from the EU have shared similar histories to us, they are also predominantly Christian or have no religion. Immigrants from outside the EU, who will largely replace EU migrants, will be mainly from Asia and Africa and will be predominantly Muslim, Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist and have markedly different histories, i.e rather more culturally diverse than immigrants from Europe. It is not about security or influence as we will be losing our seat on one of the most important forums in the world, probably second in its influence only to the UN. It is not about jobs as 28% of British companies have said that they have already made plans to move part or all of their businesses out of the UK in the event of a no deal. So that seems to leave sovereignty as the reason why people want to leave the EU. They prefer to be governed wholly from Westminster, however good or bad the government is, rather than being governed partly by Westminster and partly by the EU. Personally, as a citizen of the UK and the EU I don't care which governs me. I only care about whether they do it well or badly. I have generally been very dissatisfied with the Westminster government over the last 40 years. Although I don't agree with everything the EU does or has done, in general I feel it has been doing a reasonably good job over the last 40 years. Nearly all the problems in the UK that I recognise, are directly attributable to Westminster policies and have little or nothing to do with the EU. However other people may have different experiences and problems that are attributable to the EU. I haven't seen them articulated as yet, so I am still confused about why so many people voted to leave the EU and still support leaving the EU.
1/1	It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore BREXIT is happening whether you like it or not. Rule Britannia
0/0	It feels odd listening to educated people in background talking about leaving. and also disheartening. And blaming EU seems so odd
1/1	It has been difficult for the EU to effectively resolve the immigration crisis, and immigrants will take up jobs and schools for British citizens. I support Brexit and we can control immigration.
1/0	It is a POLITICAL Union, but the British never got it. That is one of the reasons why Brexit happaned
1/0	It is a POLITICAL Union, but the British never got it. That is one of the reasons why Brexit happaned.
1/0	It is a bit like the Gandhi thing ‚Äî first they laugh at you, then they attack you, and then you win.
0/1	It is a fact that they have professionally squandered Winston Churchill‚Äôs legacy
0/0	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract.
0/0	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract.  Sadly, the simplistic pro-Brexit arguments appealed to a lot of people who were looking for simplicity. Either yearning for long gone days of British supremacy, or looking for someone to blame for their own lives. 'It's the EU's fault that you're poor. It's immigrants' fault that you struggle to find a decent job. It's not the global financial system, exacerbated by the deliberate policy choices of the British government at all!'
0	It is a genuinely dangerous situation. What happens when people actually do realize the cost of brexit, and rather than protecting institutions like the NHS, will likely destroy them. What happens when Labour's promises of rolling back austerity turn into ash as the UK government faces a serious post-brexit fiscal crisis?
1/1	It is a great pity that the Remainers are incapable of seeing the aims of Brussels. It will be like the Jackboots over again just without them. Oh how I wish they would wake up.
1	It is about time you remainers see the true EuropeanUnion .IT is their way or no way.We need to stand as one against the none elected Bullies of Brussels.
1/1	It is an absurd another referendum on the same shit. People already decided, you cucks!
0/0	It is because ignorant voters like yourself have no idea how modern economies work, that we are in this mess.
1/0	It is disgraceful. Hitler would be proud of these kind of tactics.
0/1	It is eight weeks till we leave the EU. And we don‚Äôt know anything about what kind of Brexit it will be.  I cannot really believe I wrote this and I am not dreaming.
1/1	It is far more likely that our growth will exceed the 1.5% they attribute to signing up to Mendacious May's Appeasement of the EU.
1/1	It is getting tiresome, listening to people telling me what I did and didnt vote for, when I voted leave. Some of us have these things called principles. I voted to LEAVE, if that means we are poorer in the short term then so be it.
1/1	It is good to see an academic who tries to balance the Armageddon prophecies of the Remain propagandists. We now need a paper laying out the psychological effect of freeing ourselves from the bureaucratic, moribund EU.
1/1	It is highly desirable therefore to free ourselves up to trade with the rest of the world which is growing more rapidly.
0/0	It is just a new way to blame the UK problem on the EU. Now the EU is so cruel and arrogant cause of not renegotiate backstop what is already agreed on. They simply can‚Äôt do that. If u crash, they will tell u the EU is playing unfair so u can‚Äôt get trade deals, it‚Äôs all just for political gain.
0/0	It is manifestly "wrong" because it makes no sense, it doesn't solve their problems, it doesn't give them any more "sovereignty", it gives more power and influence to the very people who make their lives hell and the whole nation will pay for it for decades of lost wealth, health and reputation.
0/0	It is more likely Scotland will leave the UK and thereby end the Great brittan union than the loss of the UK will lead to the end of EU
0/0	It is not a nightmare to be in the EU. What planet are you on, brexiteers ?
0/0	It is obvious now that brexit will become a series of exceptions that only benefit the rich, or big industry and the banks. Travel will be compromised for 'normal' tourists, the pound has already collapsed, and the NHS cannot run without staff.
0/0	It is patently obvious that we were not informed enough to make a vote. They made a vote showing discontent and I understand this discontent. However I believe we are all more informed now to make a better call on this.
1/1	It is pointless voting for pro EU freeloaders like most of our MPs are then whining when they try and sabotage Brexit.
0/0	It is probably the biggest fuckup to happen in Europe since WW2 and it would be ridiculous to not say so
1/1	It is reasonable to believe that older voters voted to leave , I as one voted to leave the EEC in the 1975 referendum , older voters have experienced EU membership over a long period and a better placed to judge the merits of the EU . Britain wanted to join the EEC , I think John Major made a big mistake to sign the Maastricht Treaty without a referendum . I do not believe that young people are EU enthusiasts , it is EU officials politicians and business people who push the idea .
0/0/0/0	It is seriously going to hurt UK and in the end EU will offer to help and let them back in but only if UK agrees to specific terms unconditionally.
1/1	It is simple, the fact is that the leave campaign wins. What is the problem?
1/0	It is stupid to stay in EU.
1/1	It is the Brexiters who were, and still are, fighting for independence and freedom. Thank goodness the Remainers and their intolerant hatred of democracy was defeated.
1/1	It is the first step to genuine sovereignty. This is bad? I think it's good for any country.
0/0	It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism...We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.
1/1	It is time to bomb the EU.
1/1	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU, who for sure have their own Empire building agenda to why they do want they do. This is why the people want to leave, we want our leaders back, not puppets.
1/1	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU.
0/0	It is very sad. We live in a troubled world. Many people seem to vote without engaging their brains. I just want peace, people to get along with one another, respect their differing opinions and engage in building communities with trust and kindness.
1/1	It is well known that for democracy to work those that lose a vote have to accept the result...otherwise you have a Banana Republic. We voted leave. That is: leave the SM, leave the CU and leave the ECJ.
0/-1	It looks now like Brexit will get cancelled as the government Knows they would lose a 2nd referendum anyway! The public was severely mislead into voting to leave EU!
0/0	It makes me so sick, in fact I have just emailed genealogist this evening to check whether my grandmother was actually born in Ireland. I am that desperate to remain in the EU.
1/0	It means great britain will disolve...ireland and scotland will soon go their own way.Nobody in the world cares about england.Europe will come out stronger than before.
1/1	It means it is the beginning of the ending of Globalism! It is the start of a glorious age! Next stop is TRUMP 2016.
1/-1	It might not all be true, but a hell of a lot of it is... I will be happy to see the EU crumble and Europe flourish once again... to regain it's cultural mantle...
0/0	It needs to be understood by everyone that large corporations such as Airbus are not making irrational threats when they talk about relocating operations after Brexit
1/1	It says a lot about the government and parliment.. When they keep remain on a table when all of them were Elected on a manifesto to leave...
0/0	It seems like Brexit is a miserable failure of our time.
1/1/0	It seems the BrexiTraitors not only expect the UK to break the Good Friday Agreement but want a return to the Troubles.
0/0/0/0/0	It seems to me that the UK is shooting itself in the foot.
0/0	It seems to me that, since it is likely that Russia interfered with the referendum, a second vote is justified.
1/1	It should be so simple to make the Irish Backstop Agreement time limited. This would pass through the commons. However, it was never the intention of the EU to let Britain leave. To make a success of Brexit would undermine the whole of the EU. Therefore we will have to leave with no deal. Brexit will benefit Britain in the long term. Remainers sadly can't see beyond tomorrow.
0/0	It sounds like Brittain has the same problem the US has in this reguard: when a misinformed idiot's vote counts equally as much as a well-informed person's vote, stupid stuff happens. Sadly, the idiots vastly outnumber the intelligent, largely because politics is complicated and having a complete picture usually requires a lot of study (especially when certain media conglomerates make it their goal in life to misinform the populace). The UK gets to deal with Brexit, while the US has to sludge through the garbage dump that is Trump. Welcome to the crazy club...
0/0	It still annoys me that Britain left on the basis of lies, ignorance and bigotry.
0/0/0	It stresses the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts, but concludes: "The impact of Brexit on the UK energy system is very likely to be negative."
0/0	It struck me at the time, and still does, that the desire to leave the EU reached an almost cult-like obsession - Emotionally driven without any real regard for facts or expert opinion. It is such a shame because the EU is literally the least of our problems ‚Äì As you say, it has probably been supporting the poor more than our own government.
0/0	It takes Homer Simpson to nail it: ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point of going out? We are going to wind up back here anyway‚Äô‚Ä¶
1/1	It the same story throughout the negotiations - they‚Äôd love to punish us....but whenever they try they realise their actions and threats badly effect themselves too. Deep down they feel we must be punished. That is their mind set. It‚Äôs what they are constantly trying to find something to bash us with that doesn‚Äôt impact them negatively too.
1/1	It was already voted for by the people, so why ask dumb questions like this?
0/-1	It was an elaborate con by the Tory Party to get Joe public to vote for their dumbest policy ever. Even more dumb than the poll tax.
1/1	It was an honest vote, those claiming to have voted leave but now want to stay ARE LIARS FROM REMAIN CAMP.
0/0	It was never a good idea at any point; since this is also a point, no.
1/1	It was one of those historic days where you can honestly say that every true British person was proud to be British!
0/-1	It was shit then and it‚Äôs shit now and you‚Äôre the architect of all this shit. Will you apologise to the British public when the shit hits the fan on 29/3?
0/0	It was shit yesterday and the last time I looked it's still shit.
1/1	It was the right thing to do to leave. The EU is becoming an authoritarian bureaucracy that cares little for anything except power. They already want every member to adopt their failed currency by the year 2020.
1/1	It was the will of the people; it should be done.
1/1	It was the will of the people; it should be done. And if she can't or won't do it properly, Theresa May has got to go.
0/0/0/0	It wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
0/0	It wasn't a surprise after all, stupid people always outnumbered the clever ones, that is why politicians in every country are trying to convice them to become the herd they need.
0/0	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand
0/0	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand.
0/0	It will be interesting where the world will go in the coming years at this point we have two path fall in to the grip of hate or begin to fight for growing equality and start to create a better world or go back to a time where millions where killed for where they lived and what they looked like.
1/1	It will be the end of GREAT Britain if we don't leave - wish all the British people could understand that it's the most important thing in our lives right now! Transport is crippled along with every other service - we can see everything cracking around us- we all need to wake up!!!! Otherwise it's too late and we are done!
1/1	It will bounce back, this is typical market behaviour. Also no need to be so rude. Never blame those who voted, all ways those who did not!
0/0	It will get a *lot* worse if we leave
0/0	It will get even worse for those people. I did not and never would vote for a Tory government but blaming people in Brussels for decisions made in London was the height of stupidity.
0/0	It will impact not only UK  and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
0/0	It will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed , relocated or downsized.
0/1	It will still be the fault of the EU for not giving us a deal. But if the EU gave us a deal, it would be the EUs fault for bullying us into that deal, not giving us a better one, and not letting us WTO. And if the EU gave us the best deal possible, that's against the will of the people and the EU are to blame.
0/0	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can‚Äôt understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea...

1/1	It would be a great success if we get our boards back and we actually leave the EU
1/1	It would be worth every penny to be free of the EU
0/1	It would have been great if you'd written this article BEFORE the Brexit Referendum, then it might have changed minds. Now it serves only to reinforce our fears of what a disastrous impact Brexit might have, given that roughly half our trade is with the EU. If, in 20 years time, trade has shrunk, and with it our economy, I wonder what they'll blame it on? The Rich? Greedy Corporations? Corrupt Politicians? or poorly informed voting behaviour? On a more positive note: my vote for salvaging some sanity is for the UK to join Canada - if they let us in, we get the advantage of Canada's free-trade agreements, but with enough control over immigration to satisfy the malingerers and the xenophobes. There's enough commonality between us and them to avoid major culture shock, and there'd be benefits on both sides. Thoughts anyone?
0/1	It would have been so much more useful if this analysis had been done BEFORE the referendum. If people had realised all the issues involved, the outcome might have been quite different. As it turned out, I think most people were only thinking about immigration and our contribution to the EU. Remember, that ¬£300 million plus would go to the NHS. Plus there was no plan in place for leaving !!!!!
0/0	It'll harm brexiters more too, given that on average the less educated you were, the more likely you were to support brexit. The knowledge economy will absolutely leave them behind.
0/0	It'll make the UK weaker, poorer, lower their standard of living and their quality of life, limit the options avalable to UK citizens, and make the UK less influential in the world
0/0	It'll take us years to agree terms with anyone. Because if we leave other countries have the upper hand. We'll have to take whatever is being offered they know we'll be desperate. It''l take about 10 years to agree exit terms with the EU.
0/0	It's 2019. Shouldn't the world be pulling together instead of splintering apart? I really do despair. #fuckbrexit
0/0	It's OK for you, my last project was cancelled due to Brexit.
0/0	It's a bad idea to leave. The economy will collapse if we do and Britain will fall.

1/1	It's a different language than what you here from remoaners. Crystal clear sense.
0	It's a pity, but hey, f*ck off Britain, you deserve a Brexit without benefits - no solidarity goes both ways.  You have been arrogant enough within the EU,  time to STAY ON YOUR ISLAND, and sort it out yourself!
0/0	It's a prime example of how not to do referendums
0/0	It's a shame for the 48%, but it's the leadership of their country and their thick bigoted compatriots who are to blame.
0/0	It's a shame that I wasn't able to vote, if I was able to I would have voted to remain. As a teenager it is annoying that I cannot decide on my future. I don't think it is right that we have to rely on older people to 'decide for us'. Bizarre.
0/0	It's a terrible idea. Not because the EU is a good thing, because the EU is also quite bad. But because Britain is so terrible and incompetent it should never be trusted to command its own destiny as a country.
0/0	It's a total kamikaze move.
0/0	It's a very very very bad idea to leave the EU. You don't think about the Britain's futur. If Britain leaves the EU the country will be lost and very little in front of the United States of America and the oders emergents countries
1/1	It's about time the power's that be !! Should realise OUT means OUT and for goodness sake just get  On with it and tell junker to sling his hook !!!!!?
0/0	It's actually sad to see how the country is so poorly informed.
0/0	It's all ok guys, it won't cost us ¬£7 to go to Europe. You'll just pay 10-20% more for your holiday there (on top of the 15% increase already) as the pound devalues üëå
0/0	It's almost like the market wants to remain. Corbyn is totally right when he says that May has ignored what the economy wants.
0/0/0	It's almost like this whole thing was a really bad idea that no one thought through.
1/1	It's also worth pointing out that if the UK joins TPP than it will be roughly the same size as the remaining EU bloc and larger in population terms. If the US could be convinced to rejoin then it would be almost twice the size as an economic area.
1/1	It's an absolute embarrassing thing when the EU court think they can over rule the British people. We voted out and that means out
0/0	It's an embarrassing time to be English. Fear and loathing overwhelms the poorest and least educated. The people that voted to leave were sold a lie. Dear world: don't make the same mistake we did.
0/0	It's as if Brexit is a terrible idea or something.
0/0	It's bad enough I have to live with a Tory Government. I don't fancy living with an unregulated Tory Government. I value my human rights too much for that.
0/1	It's been an amazing hashtag TBH.. It's brought 10s of 000s of us pro EU ppl together here in a spectacularly short time. It's been great to not feel so alone in my daily squabbles about #Brexit 1/x
0/0	It's been two years, people have changed their minds. And if they haven't what would the harm be in another vote? Unless you're afraid remain will win this time.
1/1	It's been under pressure for the last 15 years under both Tory and Labour governments. The only way to regain control of our borders and enforce deportations is to leave. Britain for the British.
0/0	It's crap. Everyone in the UK loses.
0/0	It's dangerous if Brexit happens. UK is finished.
0/0	It's disturbingly Trump-like in style and I consider it a pretty major red flag in terms of global politics
0/0	It's entirely May's (and Cameron's) fault that this decision has to be made now, just four months before the cliff, no options left. The UK has been in the EU for fourty years and helped shape the single market, there is no excuse for them not to know how the EU works at its core. All this time they have wasted trying to negotiate with a rulebook set in stone. They should have decided what exactly they wanted (without contradictory red lines) before triggering article 50. This crisis is completely self inflicted.  May is also to blame for not preparing the country for any kind of Brexit, leaving businesses and government completely in the dark on what's going to happen, four months from the date. When one of the options includes things like food shortages and indefinitely grounded airplanes.  Of course more of the blame is on Cameron who should not have made the referendum question so deceptively simple. Lots of wildly different possibilities are all grouped under "leave", it was always a given that whatever form it would eventually take would only be liked by a minority.  The blame is on all of UK politics for still considering a 52-48 result valid when the Leave side was guilty of illegal campaign funding, huge lies, ties with Russia, and so on. The referendum result should have been declared invalid by Parliament.  Nobody in UK politics has tried to find a compromise between the sides even though an extremely close result calls for that.  But the worst are Boris Johnson, Gove, Rees-Mogg and others whose fighting for disaster Brexit for years within the Tory Party made Cameron feel there had to be a referendum in the first place. They are there for their own ego and financial gain, don't care about good government or the people and shouldn't be close to power. If no-deal Brexit happens and people die as a result, its blood on their hands.
0/0	It's far, far worse than that. Voters are refusing to acknowledge facts, facts that are very easy to verify. This isn't restricted to the Brexit debate either. It shows up with anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, climate change, Trump supporters. It's a very dangerous trend.
0/0	It's funny how the same people who want the UK to be independent from the EU, don't want Scotland to be independent from the UK.
0/0	It's funny, these idiots that voted leave didn't do much research on how hard they will fall in economy it will take them years to recover.
0/0	It's gonna be a close one! Company I work in has its European headquarters in London because of UK membership in EU and if BrExit really happens they already have move to Munich ready.
1/1	It's got to be the worst government, in the history of our country, absolutely Useless, it will be goodbye to most of them at the next. general Election , Plus the fact , thousands will not even bother to vote . because the referendum result to leave , they chose to ignore , ignoring the people's wishes,
1/1	It's great to hear that positive view of the UK. We can do it and that's why we don't need the EU. We don't need to lose any of the good laws the EU has instituted, just the bad ones and we should be able to decide for ourselves. We are a democracy and if we leave the EU what happens afterwards is down to the UK people, it's up to us to vote wisely. Better to have the power in the hands of people who understand the UK and have to live with it's policies than a group of unelected officials far removed from UK life.  I'm in a similar demographic to you and it's us that really need to reach out to similar people and urge them to vote leave. We've still got time and we need everyone we can get. We haven't won until we've won.
0/0	It's hilarious that the colored folks in UK voted for Brexit. Those idiots didn't realize brexit is all about pro-white movement.
1/0	It's just amazing to see what fear mongering can do. Look at the youth here in the US, a bunch of dumbed down kids who think the almighty government must do everything for them, and we need to keep our borders open because the people of the world should be one. Now it's all over the UK, kids who think that since their nation isn't part of a union run by globalist elites, that their country will crumble. WRONG! Britain was once a dominant world power and a trade hub. It can be that again! No wonder people hate this generation. Everyone everywhere thinks that everything should be done for them, and nobody wants to get their hands dirty and do it for themselves. Absolutely disgusting.
1/1	It's just scaremongering. We'll be ok, we're British! Rule Britannia!
0/1	It's like a crazy ex threatening suicide if you don't give them what they want. Gotta call their bluff.
0/0	It's like the people who voted for brexit didn't think it through.
0/0	It's literally like shooting one's self in the foot. Dumb AF
0/0	It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
1/1	It's not about immigration etc, at the end of the day its about SOVEREIGNTY
1/1	It's not about money, it's about freedom.
0/0	It's not bad news, it's the best chance of stopping Brexit.
1/1	It's not going to be that bad lol the government wouldn't allow it otherwise so just sit back and chill :)
0/0	It's not going to happen, simply because it can't. There's no structures in place to handle such a thing. Just look at this fact: the UK imports 70% of its food. Now tell me, how would you expect to sit at a negotiating table after brexit and have a fair negotiation with any powerful country knowing this fact? You need them to feed yourself! Its like arguing with your parents while living at their expense, you can say what you want but in the end we know who gets to decide.
1/1	It's not so much that Brexit or Trump are good for working people, it's that the EU and the globalist neoliberal project in general is spectacularly bad for workers.
1/1	It's not so much we don't want to integrate or work with Europe, we just don't want to be in the European Union and they're not the same thing. The EU is an ugly Neo-con, anti-democratic, chronically corrupt institution with a long term gain of a federal Europe, at the mercy of big corporates and private interest groups.  In the UK people think that they'll look after our interests above our own government.  But a quick look at Greece and Spain shows that they'll asset strip and privatize as their banking masters want.  There is no European public. There are still separate national publics, and there surely will be for as far ahead as we can see. This creates a paradise for lobbyists, who can (and do) act unhindered by media or public scrutiny to influence the places where real power lies in Brussels, that is with the commission and within the even-more-secretive council. The logic of the EU, if it is ever to be democratised, is to become a United States of Europe. The euro is a Trojan horse to achieve this goal of fiscal and political union. Either one needs to be a federalist, or one needs to ditch the EU. Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn and the rest are trying to have it both ways. It‚Äôs an unstable halfway house, and will fail, as in effect the euro has already failed.  The EU will fail within 10-15 years, we need to get out now!
1/1	It's not the polls that count, it's where you put your X on Thursday. Save our Country from the Dictatorship of the EU. For DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE Vote LEAVE.
1/1	It's not what big business want, it's what the British people voted for and that was to leave the EU!
1/1	It's not working due to none of the elites wanting it to work.
0/0	It's ok that we voted Brexit, because now we've exposed the 52% of Britain that have single digit IQ's
1/1	It's ok to be a brexiteer.
1/1	It's only the idiots that are holding up our leaving that are making it a farce, leaving the EU is the best thing to happen to Britain since we joined it.
1/1	It's painful to watch .. No one voted for a REMAIN deal..
0/0	It's painfully ironic that a country that never cared for the borders of other countries during it's imperialistic era and specialized in murdering, pillaging, abusing and stealing resources of other countries now has a primary concern about it's BORDERS loooool.
0/1	It's pretty obvious now that about the only people who want Brexit are either dim or troll army operatives.
0/0	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century
0/0/0/0	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century. History will judge it harshly.
1/1	It's really easy for champagne socialists in the South, in places like Bath and Bristol, to label Northerners as racist. Being at uni taught me that some Southerners are all for multiculturalism and more immigration, mainly because it doesn't affect them. Coming from such a white, middle class background means that they are so privileged and are so pretentious because non of the down-sides of EU membership affect them. Of course they want to remain it means that Daddy's company will do better and be able to hire cheap immigrant labour without filling out much paperwork.
0/1	It's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship
1/1	It's simple the UK needs to leave the EU and take care of the British people first.
0/0	It's simple, brexit will effect the EU negatively but the UK will be worse off.
1/1	It's so simple. We leave with no deal on article 24 on WTO terms with no tariffs until a deal is sorted.
0/1	It's the most full of rage I've got over anything for a long time. These people are ruining my country and for what? Nobody has even come CLOSE to defining a single realistic benefit to Brexit. All it's doing is turning the UK into an irrelevant, hate filled island that the rest of the world is laughing at.
0/0	It's time to stop brexit
0/0	It's too bad you can't force the architects of this disaster to see things through to the end and not be able to just resign.
1/1	It's true, it can be the small things in life that can bring you joy, I voted Leave, and seeing Remaoners trying to overturn a democratic vote does bring a smile on a daily basis...
1/1	It's undemocratic. None of the peoples of Europe have voted in a party that had as its manifesto "we will dissolve our nation into a superstate". Certainly not the UK, anyway.
0/0	It's unfair to say "we", a great number of people are against crashing out.
1/1	It's what people voted for. This is democracy in action.
1/1	Italian MEP has hit the nail squarely on the head. The EU us a mafia style racket and is the modern face of European Fascism. The conduct of the EU over Brexit has revealed the true nature of the German dominated EU Empire
1/1	Italy and france will likely to follow england soon..
1/1	Italy going into recession soon they can't pay off the interest of it's debt because it's economy as stopped growing and a few other EU countries are heading the same way it's time to leave now
1/1	Its a very very easy decision, and we are finally being allowed it! OUT OUT OUT!
1/1	Its actually the EU who have created the so-called "crisis" because they don't want the UK to leave. If the EU would allow trade talks, a trade deal could remove the need for customs entirely
1/1	Its all about Politics versus common sense. If the EU want to cut their nose off to spite their face its up to them.
1/1	Its all good - we're leaving No Deal bye bye EU dictators !
0/1	Its all just talk, talk, talk. They want to set an example to other members that leaving is too costly and too hard.. They will fail as the system becomes more stained and fails to function.
1/1	Its all mental - Leaving the EU will create the opportunity for a MASSIVE economic boom in the UK. I think most people have stopped buying into all the 'fear' .....its going to be amazing.
0/0	Its always the EUs fault, If we crash out on WTO rules it will be the EUs fault. The incompetence of brexiteers never gets touched on.
0/-1	Its amuses me that uk which invaded lots of countries for their own good now against immigration. UK is really a very conservative country. I think trump supporters are better than the uk citizens.üò∂
1/1	Its because europe banned memes So.... Im happy i guess
0/0	Its crazy how stupid people are. These brexiters are like the maga turds here in the states.
0/0	Its depressing especially for northerners. Liverpool as a city was given so much for capital of culture, the entire of Merseyside benefits so much yet you get ignorant racists wanting to leave just cos immigrants stealing muh jobs
0/0	Its good thing, ENGLAND leaves the EU. See what i did their? ENGLAND. Cause Scotland and Northern-Ireland will join the EU in the future. So "great britain" will be no more. I lolled so hard. Ukip leaders leaves, Boris leaves, Labour in shambles, ... It will be good for european to shop in webshops in the UK, now the pounds sacks. And lets not forget: if ENGLAND wants to have some foothold onto EU market, they have to pay MILLIONS of POUNDS to the EU to get acces to it. if not: good luck finding another 500 000 000 costumers market.
1	Its just pure basic common sense to be able to control who is allowed to live in your country. It doesnt matter what race they are or where they come from, the problem is the number and the quality.
0/-1	Its like as if EU is the sensible parent that helps its stupid kid.
0	Its not too late to reverse Brexit.
1/1	Its our traitors that need to be eliminated first.Them the EU and then Islam .Busy times ahead folks..
1/1	Its simple what we want. To LEAVE!
1/1	Its simple, we dont like being controlled by a bunch of foreign bureaucrats.
0/0	Its the UK who are the bullies. The EU have not changed their position in over 2 years - its our government who changes its mind.
1/-1	Its the working class that have been shafted time and time again and will risk anything just for a change.
0/0	Its time to say " STOP BREXIT
0/-1	Its unexplainable stupidity Always is
0/1	It‚Äôd be ideal that they stayed in the EU but I respect their autonomy.
0/-1	It‚Äôs Magic Mushroom season folks! The cabinet have just met yet again to take more mind altering drugs! ü§¢
0/0	It‚Äôs a complete shit show ...but we know May is very sinister
0/0	It‚Äôs a disaster. Please do something Hillary, we can‚Äôt allow Brexit to happen #StopBrexit.
0/0	It‚Äôs a fucking stupid thing thing the U.K. did, a shit deal and they‚Äôd have been better off voting Remain. Absolutely no positives to it. None.
0/0	It‚Äôs about people angry at the world changing around them when they have no interest in keeping up with the change. Globalisation is out of the hat. It‚Äôs not going back in no matter how hard they try. They might succeed for 2-3-5 years but the works will inevitably carry on evolving into the global village
0/0	It‚Äôs all madness! Whatever we agree to, whatever we negotiate - customs union, single market, whatever - we will never be better off out than in.  Most of our politicians have totally lost sight of reality.
1/1	It‚Äôs all very well and good, but would you trust anything that comes from the EU ?
1/1	It‚Äôs already difficult to get things done with the normal levels of government without another one governed by 27 other nations and their levels of government.
1/1	It‚Äôs because we know in our bones that it is a daft way to run a whole continent
1/1	It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSelf Determination‚Äù ‚ÄúIndependence‚Äù ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù. Great Britain was very successful and wealthy as their own Country ... before the EU.
0/0	It‚Äôs funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine.
0/0	It‚Äôs funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine. Yeah, but there were no computers and smartphones, we were just fine as well. Imagine if all computers broke today, I‚Äôm sure it will cause panic. But are human beings going to extinct because of this? No, but is it going to cause chaos? Definitely. If we want to lower the bar for living as to survive, I‚Äôm sure British people would do just fine.
0/0	It‚Äôs have to be considering we‚Äôre two months away from seeing an entire country get fucked
0/0	It‚Äôs horrifying to see everything we knew Brexit would cause happening in front of our eyes - thousands of jobs going abroad, failure of investment, total absence of trade framework.Brexit reality #LetsJustStopIt
0/0	It‚Äôs just delayed- we‚Äôll be back in the EU within ten years, so what‚Äôs your point? Brexit will fail, and this experiment will prove once and for all that we are better off inside the EU- albeit next time on worse conditions, with the Euro, no rebate, no Scottish oil and gas to siphon off etc.
0/0	It‚Äôs mad that 17 odd million can decide the fate for the rest of the 50 odd million who either were too young to vote, didn‚Äôt vote or voted no‚Ä¶
0/0	It‚Äôs not arrogance to suggest that only Remainers can think straight.  Evidence-based research, backed up with independent verifiable rock solid data shows that our Remoaner thought processes did not lead to the ongoing, ahem, very damaging and expensive shambles!
1/1	It‚Äôs not difficult, we voted to leave, so let‚Äôs leave and then we will know how it goes, neither the EU or the UK favour no deal, so let‚Äôs have a deal or we go
0/0	It‚Äôs probably only ironic to anybody who thought Brexit would be good for the U.K. Everybody else knew this would happen.
0/0/0	It‚Äôs so silly because I‚Äôm going to be affected from this deal the most as of my age and I couldn‚Äôt even vote. If all my age group got to vote their would be no brexit without a doubt.
0/0	It‚Äôs the UK government that is threatening to ‚Äôcrucify‚Äô Ireland and the EU that is trying to protect our peace agreement.
1/1	It‚Äôs time we were finally liberated.
1/0	It‚Äôs what we voted for
1/1	I¬†think even the shrillest, most unreconciled "Remoaner" would concede that this assertion is factually false.
1/1	I¬¥m brazilian and I live in Brasil. I support brexit.
0/0	I‚Äôd argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it‚Äôs very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it‚Äôs hard to come to a consensus.
0/0	I‚Äôd argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it‚Äôs very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it‚Äôs hard to come to a consensus. Plans come together based on objective positions based on data to gain agreement, there isn‚Äôt a strong data driven argument for leaving hence Brexit supporters can‚Äôt form a plan, it‚Äôs all emotional IMO.
0/0	I‚Äôd just like to point out that within the next couple of months the EU is bringing in a law that makes it illegal for big companies to avoid paying their taxes.
0/1	I‚Äôll happily spend the day after #brexit smacking the smug smirks off the swivelled-eyed brexidiots. I‚Äôll start with my family first.
0/0	I‚Äôm British and I struggle with Brexit!
1/1	I‚Äôm a brexit supporter (don‚Äôt kill me) and I still found this hilarious.
0/-1	I‚Äôm a democrat and I say as soft as possible or remain
1/1	I‚Äôm completely done with them and will never again waste my time voting, especially when my vote counts for nothing. We voted for leave not a deal!
0/0/0	I‚Äôm fed up with the never ending #Brexit mess. Why don‚Äôt they just call it off and get on with solving real problems
1/1	I‚Äôm from North America and I love watching British parliament in action not the boring CSPAN no one watches
1/1	I‚Äôm just happy we‚Äôre leaving and there‚Äôs nothing which can stop it now.
1/1	I‚Äôm just happy we‚Äôre leaving and there‚Äôs nothing which can stop it now. I love how much it annoys remainers. I‚Äôm not racist because I don‚Äôt care what colour someone is. It‚Äôs not their choice. I have no problems with anyone of a different sexual orientation to me cause it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt effect me in anyway nor is it even there choice. I don‚Äôt care what religion someone follows. I have gay friends, black friends, white friends, Arabian friends and Indian friends. All of them where brought up in Britain, they sound British, they eat British things, they hold British values, they are British. If someone wants to live here they need to abandon anything which isn‚Äôt in line with our culture including their language. Don‚Äôt care if you French , American, Brazilian, Korean, Syrian, Nigerian or Australian. You integrate your self in our country. It‚Äôs a privilege not a right to live here
0/1	I‚Äôm not in the slightest bit downbeat about stopping Brexit. We are going to have a people‚Äôs vote because they, the Leave establishment, lied to us. Let‚Äôs bin the whole thing and fix the real problems in this country.
1/1	I‚Äôm old enough to remember articles saying our civil service was so good that within a couple of years of being in the Common Market they‚Äôd all be eating out of our hands and Britain would be top dog in Europe! I don‚Äôt give any credence to the notion of us undermining from within. Staying in would carry on creating too many beneficiaries of EU largesse - expenses, security jobs, consultancies, advisors, lobbyists, media companies. I respect remainers but time has moved on. Leave now, and stay cheerful, folks!
0/0	I‚Äôm right wing and I voted out, but now I know that was a bad mistake, stocks won‚Äôt recover as FT has reported through fetchreport.
0/0	I‚Äôm so relieved about Brexit, Boris just said there will still be mars bars and water! All that worry over nothing!
0/0	I‚Äôm working class and on benefits for mental health issues and I know if Brexit goes ahead I‚Äôm gonna be one of the first people to feel the effects. I‚Äôm just constantly living with anxiety over the whole thing.
0/0	I‚Äôve always thought that however you voted we all had our reasons and opinions based on the information at hand. But anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it‚Äôs wrong. There has to be reasons why people like Mogg are fighting for this to happen and those reasons won‚Äôt be for the good of you and me.¬†#stopbrexit
0/1	I‚Äôve seen arguments that view Brexit almost as a protest vote against the EU and some of their protectionist policies, and I think there are some solid arguments there. But really Brexit just abandons any say the UK would have in the EU and any power to change those policies, while making the lives of its citizens generally worse.
1/1	I‚Äôve voted brexit and I would vote brexit again and again and again and again I‚Äôm twenty plus and proud to be English and I‚Äôm not a 70 year old pensioner
1/1	JAPAN.... Out of the EU and a prospering island nation, we should use them as inspiration.
1/1	JUST BLOODY LEAVE AND STOP THIS PI***NG ABOUT. 31 BLOODY MONTHS and we are talking about ANOTHER 12 SODDING MONTHS. MARCH 29th IS WHEN WE LEAVE, SO FFS LEAVE IT AT THAT.
1/1	JUST LEAVE!

1/1	Job done. Vote out!
0/0	Judging by their comments, most Brexiters are vile far-right r a s c i s t s.
0/0	Just 90 minutes for Remainers to get out & vote to save Britain as United tolerant country. #VoteRemain
1/1	Just BREXIT! Work out the details later.
1/1	Just Vote OUT ! OUT ! OUT ! on the 23rd of June. The Gov., of the BoE can always go back home if he doesn't like the idea of us being OUT of the EU !!!
0/0	Just a question. how would the UK survive economically without trading with the EU. I say this because IDS says that we can control our borders and prevent immigrants fro the EU entering. That would not be possible as under a trading agreement we would be obliged to allow unrestricted access. Trading with old friends like Australia as IDS says How ? The Australian economy is intergrated with the Chinese economy that is where they are now and no way could they change their economy to accomodate us. We need Europe they need us it is as simple as that and no other trading group could even remotely take up the slack of lost trade with Europe.
1/1	Just a taste of how the EU will treat us if we get trapped by May's backstop with no say. Get her out get us out.
1/1	Just another chance for remainiacs to sabotage Brexit. Don‚Äôt fall for it Jacob.
0/0	Just another stupid little detail none of these Brexit geniuses has thought about.
0/0	Just another thought. The outcome of the Brexit referendum is largely based on half truths and lies ( millions to the NHS). Shouldn't that be enough to declare the outcome void and have a new one ?
1/1	Just as in America post-Trump, the Deep State crooks will fight you tooth and nail to keep their crooked Union going. They HATE people thinking for themselves as does the American Main Stream Media. They HATE Freedom. They hate The People.
1/1	Just ask people who their MEP is.  Because they don't know. Absolutely nobody knows.  It's then a fairly simple thing to point out just how terribly they're represented by the EU...
1/1	Just ask yourselves why are we importing so many products. FFS people - we invented most of these things and used to be the country that made most of these things too....the EU has been dismantling our entire economy for forty years. .
0/0	Just cancel it. Brexit has failed.
1/1	Just close the borders altogether. Problem solved!  We are full, our housing and public services are at breaking point. Enough is enough
0/0	Just do the vote again. I'm sure that the British are not that gullible to propagandists this time again.
0/0	Just don't do brexit
0/0	Just dont leave the eu. I dont See any advantage for the uk. All I hear is they want to make their own deals. What leverage do you have to demand good deals from any country once you're out of the eu? Are you planning to set sail and colonize again? I just don't get it. There will be no more future investments - rather companies will slowly move their facilities to other countries.  Best of luck m8s. It'll be some tough years before you become immigrants somewhere else ;/
1/1	Just get out of the dam EUROP√â.
1/1	Just get the hell out and do a hard BREXIT and keep the people's wealth in the UK!
1/1	Just get us out of this undemocratic failing club - they need us more than we need them
0/-1	Just goes to show leavers really have no clue.
0/0	Just had a look around that Twitter site. It is frightening! If they hate the EU so much they should leave this island rather than inflict the loss of the EU on the rest of us.
0	Just imagine how much more money would be available if Brexit is ditched and we economic downturn averted. Stop Brexit and spend the money on left behind communities instead...
1/1	Just imagine if we lived in a place where we got to make the laws and not Brussels.

1/1	Just leave that's what was on the vote 2 years ago. Simple
1/1/1/1/1	Just leave, we don't want uk in eu
1/1	Just let them leave.
0/0	Just now, in a time where there is so much terror, we needed a unified European Union more than ever. I will never understand, how people can vote for actions that divides us, when we need each other more than ever.
0/0	Just reject Brexit. It was advisory not mandatory.
0/0	Just scanning a dozen or so comments on here is showing what a nasty place the UK is becoming. I really don't know why so much hate is coming into our society and I really wish it would stop.
1/1	Just shows how spiteful remainers are. Even put the undemocratic foreign body the EU before their friendships.
1/0	Just stay in the eu. Problem solved
1/1	Just subscribed! Time will show we who voted LEAVE were considering all points as to why the EU was a negative we can live without :)
1/1	Just tell the EU where to go with their court. What can they do throw us out good. We want that.
0/0	Just think, all this chaos and uncertainty is all for absolutely nothing. The UK will be poorer and at the mercy of despots like Trump. A weakened and desperate UK will be on the losing side of any new trade deals. Losing access to the single market and customs union will really bite and people will lose their jobs when businesses who rely on frictionless trade relocate to the EU27. Brexit will end badly.
0/0	Just to remind you, only 26 percent of UK adults voted to Quit the EU. 74 percent didn't. We have now had two long years of those three Brexiteers - Davis, Boris and Fox - pretending they were working on our exit plan, but they achieved nothing, and then resigned. Goodness Brexiteers are weak people. No plan, no work, no staying power. No nothing. Just angry bitter talk and waffle.
1/1	Just vote Leave ( them to it ) , there is nothing to fear but fear itself .
0/0	Just wait to see the Great Britain becoming Poor Britain 2 years after Brexit. Mark my words!!! Many of the brexiters don't know even now what they voted for !!!
1/1	Just walk away UK.

1/0	Keep laughing in your House of Commons. Britain is going to PAY the bill. HAHA, maybe Britain can start its business further on the Moon, USA or China. Keep your whiskey, cars and other products in Britain. We will take care about our Prosecco, wines, flowers and other food products. Britain want to leave with BIG presents. NO WAY.
1/1	Keep signing the petition leave the EU with no deal the numbers are rocketing
1/1	Keep your nerve, stay firm, the polls mean nothing. What matters is getting enough people out there on polling day. Vote LEAVE for a better brighter Britain.
0/0	Key reason for swing to Remain in latest @Survation poll is a rise to 93% in % of Remain voters who say they'd vote Remain again. At 87% equivalent Leave % little changed. Meanwhile 60% of 2016 non-voters back Remain, just 19% Leave.
1/0	Kick UK to the curb! Let them get what they deserve for their superiority complex!
1/0	Kick the Brits out, NOW
0/0	Kill Brexit
0/0	Kinda easy to make people want something when you blatantly lie about what it will do for them. Can you really say an old woman who gives a Nigerian scammer her life savings 'won' because she did it in the face of people telling her it was a terrible idea?
1/1	LEAVE EU TO MAKE BRITAIN POWERFUL
1/1/1/1/1/1	LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
1/1	LEAVE, LEAVE, LEAVE THE EU. NO DEAL.
1/1	LEAVE,,, WHAT WAS VOTED FOR AND WON,
1/-1	LEAVING THE EU DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE LEAVING EUROPE SIGH HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SAY THIS
0/0	LET'S RECAP. The Deal is dead, the Government does not have the authority to execute a no deal (there is no majority) and of course, there is no clear solution in Parliament... Shouldn't we stop this madness and get on with our lives? It is clear BREXIT is IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE.
1/1	LETS JUST F OFF WE DONT NEED TO BE PART OFF THIS STUPID CLUB.
1/1	LIES LIES LIES this is exactly why so many people voted leave, thanks middle class gits and the guardian you were our best secret weapon
0/0	LOL 1 month later and they have realized it was a massive failure. I remember brits calling out americans for being stupid, but I think americans just got a new playmate.
1/0	Labour and conservatives are traitors. Let‚Äôs boot those ignorant traitors out. No deal is what they should deliver.
0/-1	Labour argues that human rights and environmental rights will be worse if we leave. Conservatives argue the economy will be damaged.
0/1	Labour should learn what happened to the Lib Dems over tuition fees, which cost them a 10% dip in their vote from which they haven't recovered. For Labour, facilitating Brexit could be worse, and keep them out of power for a generation.
0/0	Last call: Let's not abandon ship - just when we're making headway
0/0	Last night was an embarrassment. The Brady amendment is meaningless. The Eu has negotiated in good faith and it was uk who proposed the backstop and way in which it is worded. Time to try and when back respect and prosperous future. She should revoke article 50. No sane person can say continuing with Brexit makes any sense.
1/-1	Laughable for little Tom Pr!ck to describe Buik as naive - he is an experienced and well respected City broker and commentator who was just stating the bleedin obvious. The numerous comments below expose the self loathing EU lackeys who cheer on the EU at every occasion rather than supporting their own country, and constantly seek to undermine the UKs negotiating position. The Remoan MPs are obvioulsly worse in this respect. If the like of scum like Grieve, Sourbry, Wollaston and a lot of Labour MPs (mincer Bradshawe as an example) had expended their energy in achieving Brexit rather than fighting it every inch of the way, it would have been done and dusted long ago, with much better deal. The EU have sought to use our divisions and internal bickering to strengthen their position , which is of course the aim of the quisling remoaners.
1/1	Lax border controls in other EU countries already make it easier for illegal migrants and terrorists to get into Britain, despite the UK staying outside Schengen.
1/1/1	Leave EU and mother Merkel in jail
1/1	Leave EU please, and united all british people for out of un democraty EU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brexit means brexit
1/1/0	Leave are trying to hide the shit storm their Brexit vanity project is going to rain down on us.

1/1	Leave has won. The Brexit will happen

1/1	Leave then trade,we will have a clean slate to start over!
0/0	Leave voters and trumpanzees might have destroyed the western world this year
0/0	Leave voters are the greedy, the bigots and the uneducated fools.
1/-1	Leave voters are the people the EU and globalisation has forgotten.
1/1	Leave voters are the people the EU and globalisation has forgotten. The people have spoken and it must be respected.
1/1	Leave we must and leave the stupid Varadkar on the edge of an Irish economic abyss. The UK can very soon¬† do without Irish butter. There is plenty in New Zealand that will do nicely.
1/1	Leave with No Deal (we will not be obliged to pay up)  BUT then offer the 39 bn for a 10 year free trade agreement under Article 24 of WTO to give us plenty of time to align.( 3.9 bn p.a. not all up front)  Win-win.
0/1	Leave with a no deal and then we drain our swamp asap
1/-1	Leave with no Deal. That is the Deal.
1/1	Leave without agreement.
1/1	Leave! leave! leave!
1/1	Leave!! The EU is undemocratic by its very nature.
1/1	Leave!!! Is the only way to survive!
1/1	Leave, we're stronger alone
1/1	Leave. It'll be hard for a year or two making adjustment and negotiating trade deals countries all over the world including the EU, but in the end Britian will have more control (in terms of immigration and trade) in the direction they want to go.
0/1	Leavers are the ones making the jump into the unknown and made all sorts of bullshit promises. You don't have to trust anyone to keep the status quo.
0/0	Leavers can dress it up as much as they like. the UK has made a historic mistake with Brexit and ignoring that fact won't change the outcome.
0/0/0	Leavers clearly know absolutely NOTHING about enconomics. Because if they did - they wouldn't want to leave.
0/0	Leavers didn't really agree amongst themselves on what exiting the EU meant.
0/0	Leavers please get it in your heads... No Deal is NEVER going to happen.
0/0	Leavers really are spoiled brats.
0/0	Leavers seem to have one thing in common - They're Naive.
0/0	Leavers will be responsible fo the pound crashing, major firms leaving the UK, investment drying up, hundreds of thousands of retired expats arriving and flooding the NHS with demands for drugs and services it doesn't have
0/0	Leaving EU is a monumentally evil thing to do.
0/0	Leaving EU is clearly a 'big gamble' for UK security.
0/0	Leaving EU will mean more immigration.
0/0	Leaving EU would possibly bring UK economy down and would increase problems.
1/1	Leaving aside that the anti-Brexit Observer View now anoints itself to represent what Brexit voters intended, it is most revealing that the same column that claims for itself "the universal vision of progressive societies" at the same time endorses importing foreigners for slave-labor pay and conditions, rather than agitate that if the jobs are "badly paid", then it is not the "British-born worker" who is at fault but the fault of those who refuse to pay a living wage -- and their enablers.
0/0	Leaving needs to be stopped altogether.
1/1	Leaving on 29/3 with "No Deal" continues to be by far and away the most popular petition on the HoC. Leavers, keep supporting / sharing the petition to nail the lie that "No Deal" is unsupported.
0/0	Leaving the EU in the manner we seem about to still seems foolish to me.
1/1	Leaving the EU is by far the best thing possible.
0/0	Leaving the EU is financial suicide for Britain. Yes, they will have their pride intact and that is all they will have Another Ukraine on the horizon. Ireland and Scotland need to leave Britain and not allow itself to be used by The Bank of England and they're in ongoing Ponzi scheme. The EU is the only thing keeping the Bank of England from totally finishing off the working class.
1/1	Leaving the EU is our only opportunity to rebuild our broken political scene, and free up the many good aspects of British business outside the restrictive, stagnating and non-aspirational EU market, and I do not mean by abandoning all principles of safety and decency.
1/1	Leaving the EU is the ONLY way for Britain to survive as a country.
1/1	Leaving the EU is the best decision Britain ever made.
1/1	Leaving the EU is the best option for the UK.
1/1	Leaving the EU on WTO rules is not "crashing out".¬†It's keeping ¬£39bn of our money, and having the freedom to do Free Trade Deals around the world.
1/1	Leaving the EU on WTO terms on 29th March 2019 is essential for the UK.
1/1	Leaving the EU prison system üòÄ with the get out of jail card but it's not free is it. Says it all!!
1/1	Leaving the EU will hopefully put the Great back into Britain. Give Britain back to the British.
0/0	Leaving the EU will increase immigration to UK by 5 million.
0/0	Leaving the EU will undoubtedly leave the UK worse off and will affect the poorest the hardest.
0/0	Leaving the EU would hurt Britain‚Äîand would also deal a terrible blow to the West
0/1	Leaving the European Union is not about stopping immigration its about controlling it. Mass immigration is harmful to society and only benefit the rich. Its also about Democracy we need to leave or its the end of freedom. This is a battle between the poor vs the rich and I am on the side of the poor.
0/1	Leaving was a decision after hangover, and just overturn it
1/1	Leaving will also allow us to free up our net contribution to the EU ‚Äî a staggering ¬£250million a week ‚Äî ¬≠to spend wherever it is most needed.
1/1	Leaving would be worth the short term pain for a long term gain. Let's get our liberty and control back. Vote leave.
1/1	Leftist TLDR are super pissed that all there amendments failed in the commons, NO second Referendum, No extension to Article 50, hahahah we are LEAVING. Best tell George Soros that
1/1	Leftists would rather be ruled by unelected oligarchs and being invaded by millions of immigrants who their country don't need,than being called racists or have their independence.
1/1/1/1/1	Let March 29th be celebrated annually as Brexit Day in Britain from this March onward to mark the momentous day that Britain became Independent once more!
0/0	Let everyone come!! Let us all move around and go where we want and stay in an organisation where we can go and work in Spain if we want, or Germany or France, and live among a diversity of cultures.
1/1/1	Let the British people elect a UKIP government if they want Brexit to happen.
1/0	Let the EU dissolve, so that we can see more economic growth, and an early WORLD WAR III!
0/0	Let the people decide if they want to go on with this madness.
1/1	Let them have their swansong then slap them down, exit the EU and then clear out the political sewer that is Westminster. That is what they really fear. They want to hold on to the EU teat and keep their indiscretions a secret. The expenses scandal is just the tip of the iceberg.
0/0	Let these idoits see there jobs dissapear, what Brexologists dont understand is no one cares anymore. Let them eat freedom!?
1/1	Let us know when you want rule from Brussels.
1/1	Let us leave this undemocratic broken union
0/-1	Let us never forget this. They are utter liars.
0/0	Let us see how it is in the end. Uk will not have a plus in the end.
0/1	Let's also bust another Brexiteer myth. There has been limited visible negative economic impact so far "post referendum" for two reasons. 1. We haven't left yet...only when we have will the economy get hit. 2. The pound devalued from around 1.3 to 1.1 which boosted UK competitiveness.
1/1	Let's be brave and leave without a deal, things have a way of working out. Fed up of the EU calling the shots we should be in the driving seat.  At least this expert is saying it's not a doom and gloom scenario if we have no deal!
0/0/0	Let's be honest here... England is sinking like the Titanic.
0/0	Let's face it, the UK is no longer the imperialist powerhouse it use to be, and imperialism is not going to come back into fashion anytime soon. Nor do I think UK would be able to, with American military might. SO now you have a country that has no gunboat diplomacy left
1/1	Let's get it done with already, Brexit 2019, Making Britain Great Again.
1/1	Let's get on with it.
1/1	Let's get out on WTO terms and come back in ten years and ask the people if they wish to rejoin the undemocratic and corrupt cesspool that is the EU.
1/1	Let's get out under WTO. I didn't vote for a f------g deal, nor did I vote for meetings to satisfy the side that lost ie. the Remainers. We're now heading for a soft Brexit which will be just the same as not leaving. What the f--k is happening! The remainers in the Government and the country have caused this whole fiasco. If we had left under WTO rules 2 years ago we would have been over the initial economic disruption and pain by now (which a lot of us Leavers accepted would happen) and on our way to a bright independent future, while the EU would continue it's inevitable decline. F--k.
1/1	Let's hear the British Lion roar on Thursday ! Take back control of our destiny and VOTE LEAVE!!
1/1	Let's hope Brexit heralds a new era of prosperity for this nation! One thing is for certain the remoaners won't admit it even if it is!
1/1	Let's just get out ..no matter what!
0/0	Let's just hope that the hysterical screaming brexiloons who want to rip us out of the EU without any sort of arrangement despite apparently not understanding how either the EU or the UK works will accept the blame if it all goes wrong...
1/1	Let's just leave bloody EU
1/1	Let's leave and make Britain great again!

1/1	Let's rebuild our new sovereign independent country from 29th March.
0/1	Let's see the quitters Project Fear their way out of this.
0	Let's stop the Brexit gravy train by stopping funding. Then we can withdraw article 50 and get back to the EU as a full time member, ready to fight its waste and make it work for us all.
0/0	Let's support Remain option, Europe is the only way to afford the future. Alone we lose!
0	Let's take back control of our laws." So far: Vote Leave: broke the law, LeaveEU: broke the law, BeLeave: broke the law, Facebook: broke the law, Constitutional Research Council: broke the law Today. Eldon: broke the law #antibrexit
1/1	Let's take back control!
1/-1	Let's think about creative solutions. Said no remainer ever.
0/0	Lets build a wall around UK
1/0	Lets declare March 29 a public holiday in U.K. !
1/1	Lets get a No Deal we will be better off, we managed before we joined the EEC we‚Äôll manage again out of the European Union
1/1	Lets get our control back from these nutter liberal Europeans.
1/1	Lets go back to plan A - leave with no deal - as voted for in 2016.
1/1	Lets have another peoples vote & vote for a hard Brexit to shut the self serving slime up
0/1	Lets hope it fails
1/1	Lets just leave No Deal no money bye
0/0	Lets just put this simple and clear. The day we leave the EU, ALL our international trade deals stop, not just with the EU, ALL OF THEM. We. Will. Not. Have. Any. Trade. Deals. With. Anyone. The. Day. We. Leave.' No for Brexit
1/1	Lets leave this lot are screwing us into the ground, they have held us to ransom and we don't need them but they need our money to hold up the other countries that don't contribute any monies but take as much as they can get, so lets get out
0/0	Lets not forget why the EU was formed in the first place, amongst all the anti-muslim racism, the EU was formed at the behest of Winston Churchill to prevent another World War, and up until now it has worked.....
1/1	Lets stop the moaning and get behind the most exciting change the UK has seen in decades!
1/1	Letting in millions of culturally incompatible migrants has shafted the young. Brexit is the solution.
0/0	Letts stop being a biased idiot, ONLY one-third of 'The People' voted to leave the EU (a minority) Theresa May is rightly trying to satisfy the TWO-thirds who did NOT express any such will to leave.....Tell us how YOU would go about doing that Quentin or would you simply ignore the Plebs???????
0/0	Let‚Äôs be clear: enabling Brexit means allowing a hit to economy which we know occurs in ALL Brexit scenarios.
1/1	Let‚Äôs do a Trump ! And build a wall !
1/1	Let‚Äôs leave the EU! The media just makes up the Brexiteers mind. Not going to work media
1/0	Lies, lies, lies, Telegraph. Overloaded with Remainers?? What utter nonsense.
0/0	Life has been too good on this planet. People need some awfulness in their lives, otherwise they get bored. Lets bring back first 50 years of 20th century for the fun of it!
0/0	Life in the UK is pretty shit now, low wages few opportunities. The EU does provide jobs. So leaving the EU will make a bad situation worse. Seems like you're trying to make that line of reasoning sound ridiculous... when it's completely reasonable.
0/0	Like America's last presidential election, the only way the wrong right can win, is dishonestly.
1/1	Like every once in a while I try to understand the whole system, how they talk about "soft brexit" and "partial quasi low-calory brexit" or what have you, but I just don't get their political system at all. But I can read subtext, and what I can tell is that the politicians in Bongistan are doing absolutely whatever they can to make the deal be "no brexit" despite the fact that what their people CLEARLY voted for was, fucking "BREXIT."
1/1	Like him or not, this was a very good speech by Farage.
0/0	Like many of my peers, I‚Äôm strongly opposed to the idea of the UK leaving the EU. I think the reasoning behind this is that many (younger) Remainers just don‚Äôt see the point in destroying a relationship which has not only been fairly stable, but also incredibly beneficial to the UK and its inhabitants, particularly when we youths haven‚Äôt known an alternative all our lives.
0/0/0	Like the Conservatives, Labour has yet to spell out how it will manage migration after Brexit, and has not been drawn on the size of "divorce bill" it would be willing to pay.
0/0	Likewise - a complete nightmare - when will everyone wake up and realise we should STAY
1/-1	Likewise the pound is doing its normal ups and downs - still well above the last low back in Dec 2008
0/0	Listen to people in industry who know what they‚Äôre talking about ffs. Great Britain going out of Europe with no viable trading mechanisms is a very very bad thing. This puerile ‚Äòleave means leave‚Äô mantra is just brainless rhetoric, blindly sending our country back in time 70 years to satisfy the will of a bunch of badly informed voters is utter madness.
0/0	Literally the thing that people voted Brexit for, is something the EU already does.
0/-1	Living in a border county myself, I'm kinda afraid we might go back to the troubles if the no deal happens
0/0	Living in a border county myself, I'm kinda afraid we might go back to the troubles if the no deal happens.

1/1	Local Brits may now be able to get a job
1/1	Lol @ the people who are sad about leaving because they think they're supposed to be sad about leaving. Do some research you absolute morons. This is a good thing.
1/-1	Lol everyone is attacking anyone opposed like it's the easiest decision in the world. Facts are probably wrong but I heard it was 52/48 split vote. Obviously there was no "huge majority", this was a difficult choice, and people on both sides have great pros and cons to their reasons. So instead, major kudos to EVERYONE that voted, no matter the side. Utilizing something other countries rarely get a chance to do.
0/-1	Lol gov defined poverty is lower now . Lol gov defined ofsted standards are higher now with what was poor becoming good , and good becomes outstanding .
0/1	Lol this is rather silly, some people are acting like countries don't trade between each other if they are not part of the eu.
1/1	Lol. Germany is trying control Europe for a third time in a century. First was through an Emprorer, then National Socialism, and now a post-national trade union.
0/0	Lol. More claptrap and balderdash from Hannan. The EU has been consistent for months on the backstop. Totally consistent. The UK govt agreed the deal. All 27 EU nations agreed the deal. The only hatred is from the army of Brexitters fighting world war 2 in their imagination with the EU cast as Nazi Germany.
0/1	Lol. The vitriol has been from Brexitters. You won. Get over it.
0/1	London march against #Brexit utterly futile. Yes, we want to stay in, but...look north. Winter is here
0/-1	London needs to negotiate it's contract with the rest of the country.
1/1	London voted Remain because it only has 40% indigenous British people and most of those are under 30 hence have been brainwashed by the education system with the Far Left Liberal's PC MC BS of love of Globalization.
0/0	London was the only thing keeping your nation afloat. Now thanks to brexit say goodbye to the financial industry!
0/0	London will lose its European Union capital and will lose its wealth swiftly, Is it worth?
0/1	Long live the EU, UK can burn
0/0	Long live the Eu!
1/1/1/1/1	Long live the free and independent nations of Europe Death to the EU
1/1	Look U.K. is leaving wto in March we will have skilled migration only. Get used to it. The U.K. doesn‚Äôt want to have a euro or lose its nation. This is the main win for the U.K
0/0	Look at the idiots comment about Islam, what has Islam got to do with Brexit? Maybe they should have called it leaving the EU rather than some catchy phrase that the ignorant among us exploited. Brexist sounds more like a biscuit then our Pound becoming worthless in the worlds market.
1/1	Look at the trade policies of the EU and tell me they are pro-global. It's the biggest protectionist racket on earth.
0/0	Look on the bright side, once BREXIT is sorted, May will go!!!
1/1	Looking at the basic level, why do we even need an EU. If ASDA needs more cheese and wine their buyer phones an exporter in France, "" send me 100 tons Camambert and half a million bottles of beujollies, cheques in the post "" . If the Italian army needs more Land Rovers or RR engines they phone Solihull or RR. Why do we need massive luxurious buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg staffed by spoilt pampered bastards on huge salaries and perks for doing bugger all. If at the next full sitting of the EU parliament a meteor came to earth and wiped out the lot of them, Europe wouldn't come to and end, nobody would notice no difference.Shower of tossers, they sit there and applaud each other for their wonderfulness, insulated and detached from reality.
0/0	Looking at these comments that are glad that the UK left is...laughable
1/0	Looking forward to the 60% council tax cut and 350 million a week because of Brexit
1/1	Looking forward to the collapse of the Soviet Unio- I mean, European Union.
0/1	Looks like No-Deal Brexit is on its way. EU's Barnier will NOT renegotiate the Irish backstop. A total failure by PM May, her cabinet and the House of Commons.
0/0	Looks like a pain sandwich
0/0	Looks like the UK is headed for the bin, at full throttle.
1/1	Lord Adonis - arch evil! "People's Vote?". Was he asleep? We have already HAD one !
1/1	Lose our say in the EU, gain our say in WTO and a dozen other organisations where far more of world trade rules are decided.
1/1	Lost Europe? EU is not europe, Britain has strong possition in europe and can make their own trade deals, even without EU and it¬¥s stupid regulations of free trade, honestly EU breng NOTHING good to Europe
0/0	Lost it at 'dictatorial United States of Europe'. Who believes this shameless spreaing of lies?
0/0	Lost opportunities Lost education Lost investment lost jobs lost health lost security, #Stopbrexit
1/1	Lot of remainers taking the stand again,on these comments page you can never ever get it into your thick skulls that the EU is already crumbling,and this country is the first,followed by Italy,France,and the rest will be history.
0/0	Lots of Leavers believe that #Brexit will be "short-term pain for long-term gain". That TRILLION DOLLARS in assets that HAVE ALREADY LEFT the UK ain't coming back. Those companies ain't coming back. That FDI ain't coming back. It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
1/1	Lots of anti-Brexit trolls out this morning dedicated to preventing sensible pro-Brexit debate. I don‚Äôt know who they‚Äôre aiming their drivel at. Their narratives (a polite term for lies) have no traction with anyone with half a brain.
0/0	Lots of great laws would never have happened if they weren't introduced at EU level.
1/1	Love Europe Hate the EU
1/1	Love cooperation and trade. Hate being ruled by an unelected elite. Out.
0/-1	Love him or hate him he was a leader and that‚Äôs what we lack now. The wrong PM and without an opposition and we are in the biggest crisis since WW2. Even May knows this road we take is disastrous but on we go to tumble over the cliff edge.
0/-1	Love watching American commentators on Brexit they‚Äôre often very misinformed or misinterpret information.
1/1	Loved being called a xenophobe and a nationalist all in one sentence. Social scientist of the ELITE, definitely.
0/1	Loving the Brexiteer extreme rhetoric about how the EU owe the UK for past events. Ever thought the rest of the world (or at least the old "Empire") may be thinking the same thing when it comes to future trade agreements with the U.K. for the hundreds of years of pillaging and occupation? Be careful what you wish for and the tone you adopt when dealing with others

1/1	MPs need to know voters who voted to leave would still vote leave There's been no change in how people feel about the EU and how it effects them. British jobs for the British tax and Stamp payer.
0/0	Macron and Co are risking recession in Europe just to teach Brexit Britain a lesson
1	Main Stream Media is cancer! And this headline "How Britain lost Europe" is deliberately confusing to people. The UK voted to LEAVE....we voted....understand?
1/1	Make Great Britain GREAT again
1/1	Make no mistake the underlying reason for Brexit was immigration.
0/0	Make stupidity great again.
1/0	Make sure you stay in Malta!!! Sit ans stay....... STAY!!! Vote leave people.
0/-1	Make sure you vote. Today's referendum will decide our future. Britain doesn't quit - we lead #voteremain
1/1	Makes me sick those who think Britain will struggle to survive without the corrupt EU.
1/-1	Makes not one ounce of difference, people's opinions and reasons are excuses for their own decisions.
0/0/0	Making two million people unemployed overnight is more likely to lead to social unrest.
0/0	Man, I still don't understand this. But it sounds like no one really knows what will happen. Why don't they just draw on a big white board what is good about the EU and what is bad about being in the EU and start passing some laws to remove the bad pieces. Like if they don't like the free movement of goods and people from country to country put in a road block where you vet each immigrant. This law is like a local ordinance that supersedes how the EU does business. For example I live in a town in the US where it is illegal to sell alcohol or operate a bar. The town just doesn't want it. So when we want to go to a bar we drive over to Chicago 10 minutes away. At the end of the day don't worry about British company stocks soaring way down and Euro in a free fall down. These are actually good things and they are happening merely because of stock traders (legalized gambling) want to push it down. So why is it good: 1) Because the company is still a good company and now when you save you can buy more shares. You don't look at what it's doing you just save every month. And 2) the Euro going down means you are crazy competitive with the US, China, Japan, and every other non EU market. Every country wants to devalue it's currency. There is a gentlemen's agreement that no country will do this on purpose. But Japan and China are masters of it. And you guys go a huge devalue and you didn't do it on purpose. Finally don't believe the BS that you can never go back. Of course they will take you back, they never wanted to lose you. Just don't panic. Do what you do best everyday and it will be all good!
1/0	Many Brexiters couldn't understand only words. I read them writing things like "we've have always been a great country, an Empire". Yes, but you can't eat the Queen's crown .. It's all sooo incredible.
1/0	Many EU countries oppose Islamification of their countries
0/0	Many companies high and low profile have left or will be leaving these shores because of #brexit. It's not just Nissan.¬†#brexit is damaging to most, if not all UK business.
0/0	Many current UK firms have already either moved abroad or are making plans to do so. This is proof there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit
0/0	Many economists pointed out that Brexit prevented the UK tackling broader issues, such as chronic under-investment, poor productivity, fraying public services and ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù levels of deprivation.
1/-1	Many people felt that EU institutions were not good for the UK. Maybe it was because that they though the UK would lose autonomy to EU institutions.
0/0	Many people hate the EU because they are jealous!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Many think the grass is going to be greener on the other side without knowing there's even going to be any grass on the other side
1/1	Many who oppose the EU believe these institutions no longer serve a purpose. Not only that, these organizations take control away from individual nations. Mistrust and fear of losing control made Brexit a reasonable solution to them.
0/0	Mark my words, there will be riots on the streets if Brexit goes ahead.
1/1	Martin, I don't think it's true that the Conservatives are the party of Leave and Labour are the party of Remain ... both parties are split. This isn't a simple left right issue. I voted Leave and ever since I keep hearing that some sort of compromise is what we should have because it has what Leave voters wanted - sorry I voted to Leave not to compromise and all the Remain voters who tell me I'm a dick didn't vote for a compromise either. Let's face it no one voted for a compromise that doesn't have any of the possible benefits of Leave and doesn't have the benefits of Remain either. I believe in delay and a second vote because if our politicians cannot deliver Leave, and from the mess we seem to be heading for they don't, then I would vote to stay because at least we get the benefits of staying and not a deal with no benefits either way.
1/1	Mass-immigration/migration does not concern you? Haven't you seen Sweden or Germany's current state?
1/1	May and Corbyn met to discuss how they all going to be sacked at next GE for being useless instead of getting on with true Brexit
0/0	May and the pro-Brexit idiots think England still has an empire and rules the seas......
0/0	May be a second referendum now that everyone is well informed about the situation could make sense. If it is really your decision to leave it will be reconfirmed but if now people have understood the situation and will vote for remain in EU the politics should follow the will of the country. My question is : it is all this really worth?
1/1	May desperately trying to scare us to submission with any horror story in order to keep her Euro buddies happy.
1/1	May is a traiter simple as.
1/1	May isn't really interested in what the people want. She  is blindly leading us on an unknown journey down a path to economic oblivion.
0/0	May's deal means recession, Hard Brexit means depression
1/1	May, you anti British traitor, you have had long enough to work it out and you have no intention of leaving. You're the worst and most loathed PM in all of British history.
0/0	Maybe UK doesnt care but we need eurooean union for us to stay in peace and be able tu defend against our neigboar wich is... cough... Russia..
1/0	Maybe if the economy is destroyed for my kids or their kids I will regret it
0/0	Maybe they're anti-Brexit because all the facts support that position. How about making an actual rebuttal to the facts presented? When Brexit is demonstratively a colossal failure are we supposed to ignore that for the sake of being "ubiased"? That's not being unbiased, it's being a moron. There are no upsides to Brexit other than some sort of fucked up "moral victory" you feel you've accomplished. Congratulations, idiot.
0/0	Maybe you shouldn't ask to get what you deserve. Iowans and trump voters and Brexiteers.
0/0	May‚Äôs brexit is such a mess that all the dustmen in London cannot clean it up.
0/0	May‚Äôs bribe won‚Äôt stop Brexit inflicting more pain on Labour's heartlands
1/1	Me I am A great Believer in the British People, and why not, do we not remember 2008? The Brits did what the Brits do got their heads down and dealt with it, didn't we just! Did we riot? no! Did we moan about getting ourselves in trouble and how it was every body else's fault? No! We got ourselves out of it. The British People are Great and out of the EU will make us GREATER Have pride and belief in yourselves. Vote Leave!
1/1	Media hysteria! Brexit was a must. Any other result means no democrazy for British citizens. To many young know nothing about all the powers the Liberal Politicans has given away to EU since 1972. In EU you dont controll your own environment, not your own resources, and in the end not your own law and probably not your own police and military. And what do you have then? Yes a superstate where you have no say. No individual rights etc. It is astonishing that so many young people do not understand this!!!
0/1	Media people such as yourself are definitely responsible for misinforming the public to get your own way whenever you can.
1/1	Membership costs ¬£350 million/annum. I believe it's a lot higher due to 'total cost of ownership' and lost opportunity
0/1	Might even invest in our youth like we used to do before greedy bosses went for the cheaper option
0/1	Migrants must have learnt their manners from watching Farage on EPTV.
0/0	Migration isn't a negative its a positive.
1/1	Millions of Europeans are hoping that tomorrow will signal the end of the EU.
1/1	Millions of lives have diminished since we joined the EU. Remainers only care about themselves and don‚Äôt believe in quality of life
1/1	Mind the gap.  as opposed to EU policies
0/0	Mirror: Vote today and #VoteREMAIN for the best future for you, your family and your country
1/1	Mmm the Leftist Tears, how delicious. I'd rather have independence from a Union that hardly benefits the British people, and they have no say in what they want. This is the best thing that can happen, and I don't care what those Merchants do, they try to scare us into accepting the EU, I'll never accept the EU.  The EU is a poison, and the left fails to see it.
1/1	Mogg is going soft. ..... UK should have left the evil EU on the 24th. June 2016. ..... Nobody voted for a deal. ..... This delay has already cost extra ¬£Billions. ..... Only the 29th. March is acceptable and not a day later.
0/0	Money is flowing out of London as UK makes a brexit FTFY
0/0	More Remain than Leave supporters who, for whatever reason, found voting too difficult, chose the easier option not to vote
1/1	More contempt shown to the people by remainers makes Brexit that little bit sweeter. I've got a bottle of champagne chilling for the day Article 50 Is triggered planing on watching remoaners crying in the streets on the news as I sip it.
1/1	More control over immigration: How dare those EU migrants come over willy-nilly and take our jobs and how dare they claim our benefits! And how dare the EU force us to accept this lying down! (sarcasm aside, this is actually a big problem for the economy especially given the migrant crisis where we are simply running out of resources and space to facilitate relocation on such a scale)
1/1	More irrational lies.  The UK will trade with the single block as does every nation on earth, with a small, 4% tariff - worst case scenario.  The EU is the cause for the rise of the right in Europe.
0/0	More jobs, lower prices & safer streets: why we're #StrongerIn - vote REMAIN tomorrow to keep Britain strong
0/0	More likely because the people‚Äôs choice is stupid and founded on false information. This whole affair proved that direct democracy can backfire a lot
1/1	More propaganda beening spewed out, by little puppets of the European government of the UK.
1/1	More propaganda..... Do not listen to this video at all.... Form your own opinion... This video is a sham
1/1	More remainer bullshit is it... damn the government and media really do want a civil war don‚Äôt they...
1/1	More stupid¬†#Brexit¬†scare stories #UK¬†will run out of¬†#medicines¬†- but they are easy to transport, should be easy to import from non-EU countries,¬†#India¬†is a big producer of#generics
0/0	More tea, less Brexit.
0/0	More than 50 per cent of our exports go to EU countries, we need to remain
0/-1	Morons.
1/1	Most Brits are annoyed and fed up with the bullying approach of the EU Commission and Chief Negotiator and leaders of other EU member states Britain has always seen as its closest allies. Had there been another referendum, the result would have been even more in favor of leaving the EU.
0/-1	Most MPs are against no-deal Brexit, they have now massively voted down the Deal, and that leaves no-Brexit.
0/0	Most bizarre act of national self-harm in recent recorded history.
0/0	Most educated people wanted to remain in the EU, though.
1/1	Most importantly: SJWs didn't want it. Their reason: Britain losing it's sovereignty is a payback for colonial days (I can't make this stuff up folks).
0/0	Most of the people that they polled in Britain admitted that they didn't even know what Brexit really entailed. The fact that Donald Trump thinks that Brexit is good business should tell you already about how dumb that decision was.
1/0	Most of these are not experts they are people who may have to work harder, most appear to believe that all imports from Europe will stop after Brexit once we leave on no deal the EU will come to us for a deal as they export much more to UK than the other way around.
0/1	Most of this makes sense until you consider the northern Irish border and then it's a shitshow
1/1	Most people don't want to live in a united states of Europe. They want to live in a country called Britain.
0/0	Most us "doing OK" voters have moved on from that position by now Gary. If the poor want to be poorer, let them follow Mogg over the precipice . They can/will blame who they want, like usual. They can wrap themselves in the Union Flag to keep warm, and eat platitudes for food.
1/-1	Most voters, irrespective of their vote, listened to the arguments and did not make their decision lightly
1/1	Most younger voters would not bother voting again, there would be no massive cash injection for a pro remain leaflet to every home in the UK, nearly all the horror predicted by project fear has been. proved completely baseless. With no government backing I would expect leave to get over 60% of the vote.
1/1	MostBrits want to leave the corrupt Eu
0/0	Mps should listen to the future population more than the dying one, antibrexit
1/1	Ms Cooper is trying to stop Brexit so she can spend more time looking after refugees in her home the hypocrite
1/1	Multiculturalism does not work. UK is not country for mass immigration
1/1	Muslims are seeking in and replacing whites
1/-1	Mussolini said: "Fascism (and communism) is the state collaborating with large corporations to defraud the people." That is exactly what we have seen while we've been in the EU.
0/0	My British friends. Please vote today and vote with your head, not with your anger. Be the change from within. #VoteRemain #nobrexit
1/1	My Greek friends here applauded our decision and hope to get their own country back
0/0	My Leave voting mother just came in to see me, after seeing a Sky News piece on Japanese trade post. She said she had her ‚Äúeyes opened‚Äù by the sheer scale of the issues we might face outside the single market, and wondered how we could let other Leave voters know.
1	My aim isn't to destroy the EU. I just want to get out. Staying in on the premise that we might (!) be able to destroy it from the inside would risk remaining in an empire that will become totalitarian and suppress dissent by force. And it will have a shiny new army to facilitate that.
0/0	My argument is that want my friends to continue the lives they have built in the Uk or in EU and not be driven away by some disaster capitalists who want to earn a fortune by screwing the UK over
0	My biggest fear is we're risking committing economic suicide, based on a "majority" granted through a protest vote, some outright lies, an illegal campaign and some voter apathy.
0/1	My children will not forgive you, or your accomplice Jeremy Corbyn, for ruining their futures.
1/1	My conservative vote will now go to the up and coming New Brexit Party, if the leave vote is not respected and i mean fully leave.
0/0	My country is a laughing stock right now
0/0	My country's gone, I've woken up in Farageland. Depressed and heartbroken.
1/1	My desire to leave the EU came from before the brexit vote was even being talked about. As I said, I wanted to be free of EU rules etc; there‚Äôs not enough of a benefit to being a member state for what we are putting in.
1/1	My economics teacher is a remainer and calls all the brexiteers dumb because of the negative economic consequences of leave, but he's an idiot because people voted leave for social reasons.
1/1	My english friends, leave E U this is the evil .the french will leave soon
0/0	My friend said if we vote to leave we'd be like "a man who burned down his house because he didn't like the curtains" Perfect.
0/0	My life was really quite nice before Brexit.
0/0	My mother in law lives in Spain. Please don't send her back here!
0/0	My neighbours go two or three times a year, they are that lucky. I don't think they realise how they will no longer be that lucky after Brexit.
0/0	My new passport has arrived. It says European Union. It lasts for 10 years - and I intend to use it as a proud European Citizen for as long as I can.
1/1	My opinion is it that it is an eye-opening experience on how stupid the average person is. There are people who vehemently defend the idea that our country should have laws and regulations created and enforced by un-elected foreigners. Why would literally anyone want that? It's literally anti-democracy. People who shill for the EU, what the fuck is your endgame?
0/0	My opinion of Brexit has been unchanged since it happened: The UK shot itself in the foot with this move.
1/1	My parents both voted Leave, they don't have any regrets
0/1	My point is that the UK's position even for a hard brexit is a lot better than some would like you to think.
1/1	My respect for the British grows every day, first and brexit vote that took back democracy and now the damming report against Tony Blair, God Bless Britain and may America learn to take it self back from you
1/1	My wife and I both voted BREXIT - for the sovereignty of our nation
0/0	NATIONALISM AND RELIGION WILL DESTROY THE SPECIES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF STUPID NATIONALISM RIGHT HERE. lol in another 50-100 years they will join again and be like "sorry our parents were FUCKEN STUPID"
0/1	NATO will be exactly the same after the vote as before, regardless of its outcome.
1/1	NO !!! MOGG ... May is an EU Jesuit she will manipulate this also ... gives her and her EU comrades more time yet again to water down Brexit ... she needs to go and Brexiteer in number 10 !!!
1/1	NO DEAL - LET US JUST GET AWAY!!!!!!
1/1	NO DEAL BREXIT IS REAL BREXIT
1/1	NO DEAL BREXIT is the only solution!
1/1	NO DEAL Here WE COME
1/1	NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN THERESA MAY'S BAD DEAL. I VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT
1/1	NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN THERESA MAY'S BAD DEAL. I VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT.
1/1	NO DEAL IS WHAT WE NEED - we'll cope
1/1	NO DEAL NOW............ We can always negotiate a deal later after the dust has settled.
1/1	NO DEAL!! we didn't vote to have compromises, more so when it's as clear as day May, and her remainer crew are desperate to keep us tied to the E U in anyway they can, the Irish backstop being a prime example
1/1	NO Deal means the EU Unemploymnt figures are going to Sky Rocket. Britain has the highest emplyment in Europe. We can do much better than that when we are free to do trade deals with the other 95% of the rest of the World. The EU will whither and DIE.
1/1	NO TO UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION VOTE LEAVE
1/1	NO deal suits me.¬†¬† I hate the EU
1/1	NO it was a simple choice that the elite did not accept so paid their news outlets to try to stop it At the risk of a Civil War
0/0	NO, of course we are not ready, 17 million morons voted without having a clue what they were voting for with ZERO agreements in place. Turkeys voting for Christmas.
0/0	NO. I say. Let's bin the rubbish that is Brexit.
0/-1	Nah mate. A facebook ad and a guy wearing union jack shoes told me leaving leaving the worlds largest economic bloc would reduce NHS waiting times.
0/1	Nah, Brexit has made the EU stronger.
0/0	Nah, the UK ain't leaving. They're not THAT stupid.
1/1	Nah, we're taking back control. That means spending the billions here on nurses etc The EU needs to learn that's there is something called consent. Ordering people around, running up massive pension debts and not telling people about them doesn't work.
0/0	Nah,unlike the brexiters I'm not the one supporting doing stupid shit just because it's never been done before .
1/1	Nationalisation of industry, Hurting the Neoliberal EU, Higher taxes on corporations, Higher barriers to capital
0/-1	Nationalism is on the rise in the West
0/0	Nationalism is the most contagious disease that makes clever nation into bunch of irrational fanatics.
1/0	Nationalism will prevail globalism will fail, Junckers EU will fall.
0/0	Nationalist parties in Europe are on the rise at a frightening pace. The question is, "Would this scenario of Europe swinging right generate a tsunami of forceful nationalism that may go extreme and become threatening?".
1/1	Need any more convincing. Out now before it's to late.
0/0	Never gonna give EU UP
0/0	Never had a blue passport and frankly, I‚Äôd rather be able to live and work in the EU, than have my passport be blue.
1/1	Never heard you come out with that when we were having mass immigration imposed on us by the last Labour government.
1/1	Never see this kind of reaction to the American Independence Day on the 4th of July (Even though it wasn't actually 4th July).  Come on, world. The 23rd of June was Britain's Independence Day!
0/0	Never seen such ugly racist rhetoric in politics like this month. Don't let hate win and  #VoteRemain tomorrow.
0/0	Never thought she was a Brexiteer, but given her intellectual level she must be
1/1	Next time do as the elites say!
0/0	Next week clocks go back one hour. Next March we go back 45 years.
1/1	Next;Holland,Italy and then Greece.The German masterplan is over!
1/-1	Nice contribution to shutting down debate
0/0	Nice one, Leavers. Cheers for that. Good decision you all made there. Top minds.
1/-1	Nissan are rapidly expanding. They don't give a toss whether UK is in or out
0/-1	No - running down the economy, depriving the NHS of staff, pushing inflation. These consequences.
1/1	No Audit in the EU for the last 9 years.........?  95% of contributions uncounted for ! let's get out before they steal anymore!
1/1	No Brexit is worse than no-deal.
0/0	No Brexit, get used to it.
1/0	No Brexiteer in the debate apart from Nigel Farage... Kinda one sided. Jacob should have been one of the panelist.
0/1	No Deal Brexit
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the best deal for Britain as we can lead the world without fear ‚Äî but Project Fear still keep bombarding us with disaster
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don‚Äôt listen to the scaremongers
1/1	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don‚Äôt listen to the scaremongers.
1/0	No Deal Brexit is unavoidable
1/1	No Deal Brexit is what i want!!!!
1/1	No Deal Is Brexit, Brexit is No Deal, everything else is a fake.
1/1	No Deal Is what they voted for in the referendum .. We don't want to be in the European union or any other part of the so called club.. I agree entirely with the Yorkshire lads post.. They should start planting ..They have held their hands out long enough.. Never met a poor farmer yet.. Bring back industry and manufacturing to this country instead of giving contracts for shipping and steel to foreign companies.. let car manufacturers leave but not the tooling and machinery..that should cover the grants given to them..by this country.. I would gladly come out of retirement to train apprentices..and I believe many more tradesmen would do the same as long as they were willing to listen and learn.. For far too long government have relied on migrant workers to fill the gaps in our work force.. There is a true saying that you don't put all your eggs in one basket..This is precisely what governments have done for the last thirty years..for to long They have been relying on financial services to fund the country..
1/1	No Deal is the only Brexit. Remainers making a deal on how we continue to bow down to the EU is not what the voters wanted, and before you say you wanted to stay im talking about the voters who won!
1/1	No Deal is the only deal... Freedom from the tyranny of the EU..We don't need the EU
1/1	No Deal is the only real Brexit; everything else is an elitist ploy to keep the UK tied as closely to the EU as possible.
1/1	No Deal then . Good bye EU Au revoir , arrivederci ! get f.....
0/0	No Deal, No Deal, No Deal..
1/1	No Deal. Great opportunity to renew the UK economy that has been coasting along for years...time to do what what Russia is doing in farming, manufacturing...very successfully. Time to roll the sleeves up and engage with the world
1/1	No EU Legislation or being "forced" to accept EU laws that we mostly don't agree with anyway (unless we agree to remain part of the EEA or maintain a trade agreement, where a lot of legislation is a must). This means businesses have a better chance of growth as no legislation removes many barriers.
0/0	No brexit is the best deal!
0	No brexit is the best deal!?
1/1	No but I'm sorry you feel how you do. I voted for Brexit and I believe that in the long term we'll be better off.
0	No but the point is the UK being worse off because of brexit is literally not an opinion, it is what is going to happen if we go through with this.
1/1	No controlled leaving, a rock hard Brexit is the best example for the EU to show the members what happens when a member leaves.
0/0	No country can be truly independent unless it deals with no one.Being in the EU isn‚Äôt that bad as things go.
1/1	No deal ! we will be fine in a few years time
0/0	No deal = Good Deal for tourists. I'm hoping to visit the UK after the pound crashes. I'm guessing there should be a 9 month window before the riots start and the UK implodes like Greece
0/1	No deal = no transition period.
1/1	No deal Brexit is fine. The UK doesn‚Äôt need deals with the EU. There are plenty of other countries to trade with. Plenty of other countries in the UK to do deals with.
1/1	No deal Brexit is liberation and independence
1/1	No deal Brexit is the best for UK.
1/1	No deal Brexit is what the majority voted for
1/-1	No deal Brexit is what the majority voted for.

1/1	No deal all the way!
1/1	No deal any deal will be a bad deal I voted out and that's what we want not a remain deal and pretend were out lol
0/0	No deal brexit wil teach British humility

1/1	No deal is a clean brexit. Exactly what we voted for.
1/1	No deal is better than any deal as thats what we voted for. Out means out !
1/1	No deal is coming and a very good idea it is for U.K. Sovereignty
0/0	No deal is coming. Hope you like poverty, brits.
1/1	No deal is just a no deal with europe. With the rest of the world trading is done by UK rather than by the EU. The UK has its independence back = more power.
1/1	No deal is the BEST deal.
1/1	No deal is the best deal for the people..
1/1/1	No deal is the best deal. Bollocks to Sky news , they are just EU sympathisers.

1/1	No deal. No money. No want EU WANKERS.
1/1	No deal. Out now! #Brexit
1/1	No deal. Out. No more talking.
1/1	No deals just leave. 1930's Germany looked a bit like the present eu, they have control of Europe and possibly May so wait for the stitch up. We DEMOCRATICALLY voted to leave, that word is not understood in the eu, but it is here. Local councils are planning for a no deal so they are expecting trouble on the streets. We voted leave, give us our wish or resign.
1/1	No delay- we leave on time and take our money with us. The UK`s problem will soon become the EU`s problem.
0/-1	No doubt the mouth breathers are blaming immigrants for their food costs going up 20% and their salaries stagnating.
1/1	No explantion required thanks. We voted out
1/1	No extension , just leave on the 29th the Eu is a sinking ship time we left.
0/1	No goodness sake.. EXIT BREXIT.. IT'S the only option to avoid chaos and reduced living standards for everyone.
1/1	No it won't because we won't have to accept random unilateral EU directives written by unelected self-interested morons anymore.
1/1	No it won‚Äôt, no party will ever win a parliamentary majority with a pro EU agenda. We never liked the EEC, we don‚Äôt like the EU & were going to hate the United States of Europe when it comes about.
1/1	No longer have to bail out failing EU nations. Prop them up
0/0	No mate. The UK needs to learn to be less complacent the EU owes it nothing. It will find out what trading outside EU is like. TPP scotched Commonwealth also 4 countries line up to veto UK's membership in WTO. The UK has thrived at other countries expense. Colonies especially. The sharks are out and there's blood in the water.
0/-1	No money , no further contracts. If UK decides not to pay , what they have to pay, then EU will see this as an hostile act and will f...the UK. Then your planes will stay at the ground, all shipment s from europe and to europe get stuck , so finally you have no other choice then to pay your bills. And thats FAIR!
0/1	No more drunken Brits abroad no more shagalufe no more zante  no more garlic bread... we will just have to go down the local pub and have a pint.
1/1	No more money being paid into a European parliament that isn't even understandable by most (more money for investing and paying off the deficit and not going into an opaque government structure that likes to spend lots of taxpayers money on ???).
1/1	No more paying out billions to the EU for exceeding our financial targets
1/1	No more time needed. Arrogant EU don't want to budge then we walk away on 29th March with our ¬£39bn and use WTO rules.
0/0	No no, the EU will hardly notice Brexit....hmmm we‚Äôll see!
1/1	No one is losing access to the EU market, the young should have voted to leave if they ever want to own a house.
0/0	No one outside the DT echo chamber thinks Brexit will be a success.
1/1	No one said Brexit would be smooth but I believe it will be better in the long term.
0/0	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all.
0/0	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all. I vote to remain EU.
1/1	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU.
1/1	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU. And then all the others who leave can have the same agreement until there is no EU left and all nations are instead part of the new free trade block instead.  There is ZERO need for a totalitarian and anti-democratic super state for the nations of Europe to have free trade with each other.
0/0	No pros. Any positive effect like temporary rise in wages will be short term, followed by closing of businesses.
1/1	No really. It wasn't economically viable for the UK to be robbed blind by (soon to collapse as everyone will leave) Europe.
1/1	No regrets. I think the reaction proves that the elites were (and in many cases still are) taking the electorate for granted
1/1	No shortage of anti Brexit fake news in the media. Every single day we have a new hysterical scare story. It is actually quite pathetic. If you want to talk about economic crash let's talk about unsustainable government debts? Oh no let's talk about house prices instead which the government does nothing but disort with their every idiotic intervention
1/-1	No should read how the EU lost Britain. As ever endless media bias and propaganda. Take a poll anywhere in Europe in the EU and explore  the results: Greece, Germany, Hungary, Poland even France Holland and Denmark. STOP your Bias !!!!
1/1	No the problem is having a seat at the table the whole political class gets paid enormous sums of money there and its why most of UK political parties are pro EU so they can get a job there after their careers finish in the UK. Its a racket and not democratic.
0/0	No to Brexit. It‚Äôs a disaster for the UK.
0/1	No we will not have what is termed Freedom of Movement in the EU. Learn what you are talking about.
0/0	No worries, you have Liam "trade deal with the EU should be the one of the easiest in human history" Fox on your side.
0/0	No worrys.....there will be no brexit. The signs are all over.
1/1	No, Poland intervened because it wants its people back in order to continue to build its economy. It is quite happy for us to be out soon.
0/0	No, brexit is bad
0/0	No, but if we do still decide to leave and trade with it... Our exports would still have to follow EU regulations. On top of that we won't be able to influence those regulations and we may also have to pay tariffs on goods we export. Furthermore, those with any knowledge of economics will also be concerned about contracts. EU businesses are less likely to invest in a country outside 1. the Eurozone and 2. the EU itself. If we leave foreign investment will likely dry up.
0/-1	No, but the entire EU decides together if it wants to trade with you. If Germany wanted to trade with the UK, the EU would decide on it, would they let us have it easy? No.
0/-1	No, his head should be on a spike on the wall of the Tower of London with the rest of the brexiteer traiitors.
0/0	No, it might have proven a good idea if we had done it on the down low after preparing for about 20 years and retooling the whole economy for more independent trade but we just decided to do this like yesterday with no preparation and made a huge song and dance about it
0/0	No, it's your mess, leavers. You don't get to pass the buck like that.
0/1	No, its not and you are foolish to believe that sum. I bet you believe Turkey is joining the EU soon and that the EU army is under way
1/1	No, the EU sucks. We need no deal and we will prosper because we're British. Tories are great. March 29th is bank holiday.
0/0	No, there are more risks leaving. Explain all the risks of staying.
1/1	No, we left the EU so we can have an easier time to trade with countries outside the failing European Union. If you're going to speak about politics, please be informed about what you're commenting on.
0/0	No, we're absolutely Fucked.
0/0	No, we're absolutely Fucked.  If we actually go through with 'Hard Brexit' (which is moderately likely at the moment) and there is no deal in March next year, you'll get to watch a pretty impressive political and economic experiment. The UK will become more detached from the global economy than almost everywhere except North Korea and Mauritania.  It'll be brutal.
0	No, we're absolutely Fucked.

The UK will become more detached from the global economy than almost everywhere except North Korea and Mauritania. It'll be brutal.
1/1	No-deal Brexit means you're no longer subservient to a govt of officials you didn't elect. It means taking back control of your own nation
1/1/0/1/1/1	No. I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
0	No. If it does it will be the biggest travesty of modern times in our country.
1/1	No. No. No. No... We voted LEAVE. MP's should do what the people of the United Kingdom told you to do and stop thinking of what they personally want. The people put you in office.. and we can take you out.
0/1	No. Now can people wise the fuck up and stop this insanity
0/0	Nobody can see what happens in the next 20 years but I say that the British people will regret their decision of leaving because they will have no voice over here anymore and are not part of important changes.
0/0	Nobody denies that a hard brexit will cause a lot of suffering.
1/1	Nobody else would have the guts. Go on Theresa
0/1	Nobody sensible wants a no-deal Brexit yet that seems to be where we are heading. Does this make any sense to anyone?
0/1	Nobody under 40 voted Brexit they said. Everyone under 40 called them selfish old people for stealing their future they said. Well turns out the reality is quite different with nearly every single young person looking forwards to a bright future outside of the EU.
1/1	Nobody voted for a poxy deal. We vote to LEAVE THE EU, all of it, like we were told would happen.
0/0	Nobody voted for this. Brexit is turning into a national disaster. And 56% and growing now want to #Remain. Write to your MP to demand they #RevokeA50 and #StopBrexit.
1/1	Non aggressive nationalism is a plus for most. Globalism is a quicksand swamp for 99% of individuals. The other 1% are cornering all riches.
1/0	None of my Polish friends are going home.. many are taking out British citizenship Poland's loss Britain gain.
0/0	Noooo! Come back!
1/1	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2
1/1	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2.
1/1	Nope, not changed my mind. Brexit please...
0/1	Nope, the immigration had nothing to do with my vote. Immigrants that work and pay tax help our economy. I think now that we're not part of the EU, any EU citizens who live over here and have built a life for theirselves should just be given UK citizenship. It would be stupid to start kicking people out.
0/0	Nope. YOU voted to leave. I didn't.
0/1	North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago
0/0	Norway has oil and is OK on its own.¬† The Swiss look after everyone else's money --ill-gotten or not.¬† ¬†So far the EU is fairly content to remain together.¬† ¬†The Brits problem is and always has¬† been the fact that they want to rule rather than cooperate.¬† ¬†They just want to have an empire again.¬† Their economy is in shitty shape due to the austerity applied in 08 and they think they can go it alone?
1/1	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland are all not in the EU, all doing fine
1/1/1/1/1/1	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland...all not in the EU, all doing fine......
0/0	Not EU's fault.
0/0	Not a British citizen, but I am living in Britain, and I am terrified of the prospect that the UK might vote to leave.
0/0	Not a single job lost Jeremy? Yesterday, another 900 jobs lost due to Brexit. And still, Corbyn refuses to lift a finger to stop this shambles.
1/1	Not a surprise is it? We voted to Leave, and we are leaving all the EU systems and institutions.
1/1	Not about the economy it's about our culture our way of life and is being destroyed we are becoming less British
0/0/0	Not all of us want to leave.
1/1	Not all people who voted out are old,young people voted out,so just get a move on And get us out.No more talk of a second referendum,17.4 mil voted out so do it,May grow a bloody back bone.
0/0	Not at all. Just cancel Brexit and be done with it. We'll all sleep easier knowing there will be food on the shelves.
0/0	Not even a hard brexit can cure a hardcore brexiteer.
1/1	Not happy with the transition period as it is. Any deal we make with another country has to be approved by the EU, not happy with that at all. Just leave, sure its a bumpy ride at first but we will be better off in the long run.
1/0	Not having a trade deal with the USA would our gain and their loss, any new president would not want to pass up on an opportunity to do business with the UK.
1/1	Not interested in any deal with Europe. Can't trust them. Or our own mps. Out no deal. Any body wants to be in Europe. move there. so true brits with backbone .Can run there own country. Like our grandfather's fought for.
1/1	Not just Europe! From Frau Merkel's latest speech she is evidently wanting world domination.
0/0	Not just the car industry but the knock on effect on associated industries like 3D modelling and other IT industries will be catastrophic. And yet the Brexiteers said IT based service industries will grow exponentially post-Brexit
1/1	Not just the imagination its the lack of handling and now the terror attacks.. we dont want to be in tbe E.U #EliteUnion is what E.U means they want to control you more and more. Bring a civil war and see who defends them against the world.. All Races should United and Disable these Old men playing war games!
1/1	Not one single person has any clue what remain means. Not one single person can say what would be the remain position.?
1/1	Not only don't pay a penny, stop all benefit payments to all EU migrants working in the UK on 31 March as well. Watch the rats run: plenty of employment, housing and no NHS waiting lists from then on in...
0/0	Not only should it be delayed, it should be re-examined. What is worse, a step back from leaving the EU or a second referendum and cries of democracy having failed, or an economy that shrinks dramatically with all the dire consequences this will bring? I know which one I would prefer.
1/1	Not quite right. Wealthy will receive zero impact to their level of life. It's middle class and poor who will get it worst. Middle class will loose standard of life, many of the poor will loose social support due to the poorer country's budgeting.
0/-1	Not really surprising for May wanting to basically keep all benefits from the EU while ditching all obligations at the same point. Also not surprising that the EU won't buy it.
1/-1	Not surprised Britain voted to leave. They are 'too good' for EU and the rest of the world. Let's face it, deep down British people think they are the BEST country in the world and therefore think they are better than people from overseas. I've lived in the UK for 7 years as a foreigner and this is the vibe I get from all places I've lived in England and Wales.
0/0	Not the end of the world but almost
0/0	Not to late to cancel Brexit and remain in the EU
1/0	Not worried, just kind of disappointed. Been in Europe my whole life and never felt particularly oppressed, despite a few daily mail headlines. The whole thing just seems unnecessary.
1/1	Nothing about what‚Äôs happening in Italy in this paper, yet. How will Remainers spin the Euro dictatorship the rest of us can see?
0/0	Nothing good will come of Brexit, for the UK.
0/1	Nothing quite says "Taking back control" like drawing up contigency plans for the evacuation of your head of state.
1/1	Nothing the Nazi EU does surprises me the bastards that is why I voted to leave to get away from these leeches.
1/1	Nothing will change ,Except we will thrive and stop paying into something that has whittled us away for 45 years .
0/-1	Nothing will convince leavers to remain. Like nothing will convince a religious fanatic that his god is an invention of a human mind. So it's pointless. But fun.
0/0	Notice how people that voted to leave were all old and will probably die before it comes into effect.
1/1	Notice how these rich people never get poorer but keep telling you it's brexits fault. Nothing to do with millions of unskilled from the eu coming here and getting housing benefit tax credits and public services having paid minimal tax.
1/1	Notice nobody laughs at Farage as much anymore?
1/1	Now I wished Scotland left, they be happier and be safer at this point
0/1	Now Scotland to leave the UK this time! and for a border pole in the north of Ireland for reunification with Republic of Ireland
0/0	Now asking UK companies to beg the EU for mercy. That Brexit's going great, eh?
0/1	Now it's not about Brexit , the damage of division among society is far bigger than any Brexit.
1/1	Now our economy will no longer be dragged down by Greece's
1/1	Now that Trump is going to be the president, I believe that Brexit will end up being totally justified, because a US/UK trade deal is going to be "bigly". The UK, being able to negotiate with the U.S. on equal footing, and without the myriad of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels creating massive roadblocks and regulation, will end up being a economic boon for both countries.
0/0	Now that the Polish workers are being barred, are you Brits ready to take their job as plumber or clean building windows?
1/1	Now the UK won't be a Muslim state, good job!
1/1	Now we have chance to engage with the modern world, unfettered by the EU's silly tarrifs and mass of regulations - mostly in place due to systemic corruption at Brussels.
0/0	Now, I am still not fully up for Britain leaving the European Union - there are still a huge amount of advantages of staying in.
0/0	OMG this is hilarious. The UK will have no choice but to pay. You made your bed now lie in it.
1/1	ONE of Britain's foremost pensions experts has warned that remaining in the EU will be catastrophic for both state and private pensions in the UK. Why are the remainiacs not putting this little gem out to the voting public. vote leave.
1/1	ONLY Jacob understands politics. He's the only brain here AND he cares about PEOPLE way more than the Left do.
1/1	OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT FOR SALE! Why can't the bremainers understand this? It's bad enough that Westminster is out of touch with the people, the eurocrats at Brussels would be even more so and we won't be able to remove them from power! So there really is only one sensible choice in this referendum and that's to leave!
1/1	OUR government CAN NOT CONTROL ANYTHING as we are CONTROLED FROM THE EU on all matters ,if and a big if we stay in ,within the next 20-30 years THE EU will have abolished ALL governments of all member states THEY ARE HELL BENT ON FULL CONTROL of everyone within the EU ,that wont worry me one bit as i will be dead,but for the last few years of my life ,i would really like for the UK TO BE FREE FROM their CONTROL VOTE ALONG WITH ME and VOTE OUT
1/1	OUT !!!!
1/1	OUT IS OUT.....WHATS THE PROBLEM.. YES WE VOTED OUT
1/1	OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT... BUT THE NWO IS IN FULL EFFECT, SCARE MONGERING AND EVERYTHING.
1/1	OUT OUT OUT! We must protect our country, culture and identity. Think about the British people of the future.
1/1	OUT OUT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/1	OUT, OUT, OUT. And of course leave the EU as well!!!
0/0	Obama is a very wise man & I'd certainly follow his advice to vote to REMAIN IN the EU. Most of the politicians who want to leave are proven two faced liars.
1/1	Obama should keep his nose out of our affairs. His arrogance is breathtaking. Seeing our leader grinning like an idiot while he threatened us made me, for the first time in my life, feel ashamed to be British. Vote Leave to regain our self respect!
1/1	Obvious remain propaganda is obvious remain propaganda.
1/0	Obviously no loss as she doesn‚Äôt realise that she never left Europe in the first place. The UK is set to leave the EU not Europe which it will always be part of. Cheerio then.
0/0	Obviously though we are all sad to lose our British friends. Increasingly though it seems that while we want the UK that was to stay we are uncertain about the UK that is. Tbh this seems more an internal reckoning that got out of hand than something to do with the EU
1/1	Of course Tusk is calling for Brexit to be cancelled. He still wants our money and as the EU have proven time and again they have no concern for what people actually want as long as the cash keeps rolling in
1/1	Of course the EU want to keep the U.K. in the Customs Union, they still want our money. When will our Government wake up and just walk. We could have saved 2 years waste of effort.
1	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.
1/1	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.they have done very well for their directors and shareholders.ordinary workers have seen their wages stagnate while the cost of living has skyrocketed.it is no good politicians quoting statistics and percentages we want to see a true rise in ordinary people's standard of living.
1	Of course they are protesting. Millions of foreigners are living and working in Uk freely because of E.U. treated. Once Brexit goes through, Millions of those people will have to go back to their country of origin
0/0	Of course we want you to stay! Brexit is a tragedy for Europe as a whole. Please stay!
0/0	Of course we won`t starve but I bet that in less than 40 years time we will want to rejoin the EU.
1/-1	Oh What a Traitor...Lets see if we hear tonight before the Polls open @ 7am.  For More Contact Leave
1/1	Oh another piece of Hollywood corporations telling us feeble minded people that we were tricked and or duped into doing something we don't want to! How will I ever know anything if not for these Hollywood corporations, thanks for looking after me.
0/0	Oh boy. This comment section shows why it's a gift for the EU that the UK leaves it. They have never understood the idea of a united Europe. They don't want to be equal, they want to be special
0/-1	Oh dear me, I have found another one of those leftist internet shitholes again
1/1	Oh dear. More anti Brexit propaganda. Did the EU pay for this? It‚Äôs clearly telling the audience that the only reason Britain voted to leave was because of an evil mastermind tricking people into doing so.
1/1	Oh do give it a rest ! Just pack up and sod off to live on mainland Europe if you think the EU is so bloody great.
1/0	Oh f#$k off with the race card ! I'm married to a Chinese ( beautiful ) lady with gorgeous half cast children ! And we support farage and also voted leave ! So stick your labels( ie racist ect )up your arse !!!
0/0	Oh for god‚Äôs sake: if Deutsche is Lehman, then the U.K. will have issues just like it did after, yes, Lehman, a company based in the USA, not the EU!!! So it‚Äôs got nothing to do with the EU! And ‚Äúdemographic problem thanks to feminism‚Äù?!? I can see where leavers want to take women, back to the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant!
0/0	Oh it's all going so well! Brexiteers still won't accept any responsibility for this shit storm we are in.
0/0	Oh look no one answered that question, typical Brexiters
1/-1	Oh look.... propaganda!
0/0	Oh lord, Brexit is the biggest political shitshow in history
0/0	Oh my god, what a shame, Brexit won, the world is coming to an end.
1/-1	Oh so nobody is allowed to vote against popular opinion then its cooked or cheated?
0/0	Oh the irony, pensioners deciding the future of the millennials.
1/1	Oh this looks unbiased and fair.... People voted leave overwhelmingly because the EU have no sovereign democratic right to make law over UK citizens
1/1	Oh yeah.  Simply because you don't like the outcome of a referendum, don't do the will of the people.  Do a terrible job negotiating and the throw your hands up and have do over.  I wonder how many pushing this decidedly anti-democratic path would feel the same if the remainers had won??
1/0	Oh yes i do. You have cried like children since the result. I wouldn't want to share a trench with any of you t its. Don't like it then feel free to move to "Europe". Idiot.
0/0	Oh yes? We're coming to get you. You have NO conception of what you've unleashed.
1/1	Oh! Dear! One less "Project Fear" Remainers can't use. Do you really expect very much to change after Brexit? Do you really expect things to change much even after a hard Brexit? They need us. We don't need them.
0/0	Oh, like you know him. It‚Äôs Buik not Buick. Typical leaver, never gets his facts straight and pretends to know more than he does while accusing everyone else who disagrees with him of manufacturing lies.
1/1	Ok remainders, it‚Äôs you we are sick of listening too, you moan moan moan, democracy no longer seems to work In this country, pathetic liberals constantly crying because a democratic vote did not go there way.
1/1	Ok so having control of our fishing etc in our waters. Why should our fishing communities be told they are at quota levels but other Eu nations can fish. Surely our priority is to feed our own.
1/1	Ok, lets debunk the fear lies; moving goods from or to the UK wont be a huge issue, not to buyers and sellers with a brain, companies are not going to want to shoot themselves in the foot to punish Britain, they still want to sell their good stuff and their rubbish to UK customers and still want to trade with good UK traders, like they do with other countries outside of the EU.Britain will make deals with other markets which will now be easier and cheaper.Britain and the EU have just over two years to sort it out, the changes are not happening next week.If people loose jobs or the mortgage goes up, that's a result of the lies of fear the Remain camp and the media were spreading; see the world didn't end.The UK was never really protected in any way by the EU, if Russia invaded the EU would do nothing, we are protected by Nato, which has nothing to do with the EU.Laws can be made or changed to ease the changes, if the ones in charge care to do so.SO STOP PANICING AND SPREADING LIES OF FEAR.
0/0	Ok, so we need to destroy the country to get rid of UKIP. I would prefer giving them dozens of seats at Westminster, they are useless anyway
1/1	Ok. Perfect. Now LEAVE! Europe had enough of your theatrical attitude. Good bye!
0/0	Okay I'm not even British but just the thought of something like that happening to a country terrifies me. Yes  it had it's pros but the cons outweigh it. At least from what I've seen and heard. Please correct me if I'm wrong because I am no expert but still, doesn't seem like the best idea.
0/0	Old people and idiots have screwed the uk.
0/0	Old people have taken away our right to live and work freely in the EU because they felt a bit patriotic. I don't recall millennial doing anything like that.
0/0	Old people voted to leave. Young people voted to stay. Who's future is it though...
0/0	Old, uneducated and unemployed are for brexit
1/1	On 25th May 1961 President Kennedy said they would enter a programme to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. It took just 8 years with the limited technology available at that time. Obama talks about a trade deal with the UK taking more than that time, absolute piffle . What this means is that the US are now so sluggish that other nations will overtake them as the worlds powerful economic nation, if not already, eg China, India and perhaps one day the UK. Vote leave on 23rd June.
1/1	On farmers.  Since the UK is not self sufficient then it follows that farmers will have an excellent market.  Carbon footprints would be reduced to.
1/1	On the ballot paper there should only be leave options.¬† The country has already voted to leave.
0/0	On the contrary, poll after poll shows the people who voted to leave now regret their decision
0/0	On the other hand they are stating that the only reason for remaining is "economic risks"... They are not considering political and military fields, or simply the freedom to move to any European country at any time. I wouldn't say that it isn't neutral, it is just very simplified
0/0/0	On the other hand, the Leave camp claim that energy bills will go down on Brexit - but that can only happen if the UK scraps its own rigorous Climate Change Act, which the government says it won't do.
0/0	On the two-year anniversary of the EU referendum, tens of thousands people took to the streets of London, UK, on Saturday to protest Brexit, demanding that the public have a say on the final Brexit deal.
1/1	On the whole we Brits love Europe we just don‚Äôt like the EU or teh way we have been boiled like a frog to invoke the long term ‚Äòhidden‚Äô plan and undemocratic process to morph the common market into the United States of Europe.
0/0	Once again, people are blaming the EU for the behaviour of greedy bankers. Let's not mix everything up, please! This old ongoing Germanophobia popular in England is really pathetic. Instead of doing well, some in England prefer to blame others for their misfortune. Start by throwing out all those third world migrants for a start (no, that's not the EU's fault, it's political correctness that is at fault). So, once again, the EU is not the problem, the greedy corporations are the problem.
1/1	Once we have left, we can stay as close to the EU as is convenient to us. Not how convenient it is for the EU.
1/0	One EU to rule them all, one EU to find them, One EU to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
0/0	One hundred years from now in history lessons the definition of Brexit will be summarised by ‚Äúno one knew fuck all at any point ‚Äú
1/1	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies
1/1	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies.
1/1	One mans reason for voting leave was because he couldn't make money killing Moles. Strychnine is an alkaloid poison. ... Strychnine has been described as dangerous and inhumane and was banned for wildlife management under the Animals (Cruel poisons) Regulations of 1963, and yet its continued use was allowed only with moles. (English legislation). This legislation was taken to Europe by the UK and ratified into EU Law but they decided that the poison had no part in a modern world when there were more humane ways of killing Animals identified as pests
1/1	One of our greatest contributions has been our long history of democratic government. In rejecting the undemocratic centralising power of the EU the UK is once again a standard bearer for democracy. The EU is heading in the wrong direction, it is destroying generations of young people in Greece, France, Italy and Spain through mass unemployment and it is entirely resistant to any reform via the ballot box. We have no choice but to leave it we want to protect the right to elect those who rule us.
1/-1	One of the basic freedoms is for people to be able to vote and decide on their own future. When the spokespeople support mass violence against peaceful voters, your institution becomes something quite sinister.
0/0	One of the dumbest moves by the UK since Chamberland signed a deal with Hitler.
0/0	One of the things I agree with Brexiteers about is it‚Äôs not all about money.For me it‚Äôs also about shared culture,shared experience and international understanding.I also think it‚Äôs about commitment to reform aspects of the EU that need it. You can‚Äôt do that from the outside.
0/0	One of the worst and saddest nights in British politics. Such a catastrophic decision, I don't understand why Cameron let this fringe-issue that no one cared about until the start of 2016 go to the public after the AV referendum.
0/0	One of those responsible for this Brexit mess, he continues to demonstrate he did not understand international trade when advocating leaving the EU.
0/1	One thing you can be sure of: had the result been 52/48 the other way, leavers would be demanding a second referendum, saying demographics had shifted n the favour (and the usual nonsense about "unelected dictators")
1/1	One year to go! It can‚Äôt come fast enough.
0/0	Only 26% of the population voted to leave
1/1	Only Germany and Netherlands seem to be doing well in the EU at the moment.
1/0	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo
0/0	Only a smidge in our economy. ¬£10 bn is 7% of how much the goverment put into the nhs each year. Not much at all, and we get billions back in science investments, infrastructure investments and ofcourse a single market.
1/1	Only corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !!
0/0	Only idiots want to leave. Unity has proven more efficient than divided
1/1	Only one chance in a lifetime to free ourselves from the shackles of the cesspit EU, please have the courage to vote LEAVE on Thursday!
0/1	Only pussies run away when they face problems - better solve them."sorry thought you were talking about all the Eastern Europeans who have fled their nations and under cut the British working class.
0/0	Only the Brits do not realise that they are a living joke
1/1	Only thing the british Government have done here is show how weak they really are to the EU who will now laugh in May‚Äôs face.. This is a disgrace just leave
1/1	Onwards my british friends, fight for your country and your liberty!
1/1	Open borders, bureaucratic, dictatorial government. The EU is going to fail, and I will enjoy it
1/1	Opinion polls are consistenly showing that the result would be reversed if the referendum were held again. Hahaha in fact your "polls" were all pointing that Brexit would win! LOL

0/1	Or vote for candidate that is anti-brexit and will follow through on their beliefs.
0/1	Oswald Mosley had 50,000 followers in Britain that wanted to welcome Hitler into country , now we have remainers who done believe we can run our own country ,Even Churchill was initially voted down when he wanted to re arm our country against German aggression. The modern day quisling remainers will have as slaves to the EU. forever , freedom now.
1/1	Other EU countries sell more to us than we sell to them, so if we do leave and they decide to have a strop and refuse to negotiate new deals with us then it will be their loss, not ours.
1/1	Other countries are excited about trading with the UK and taking away the EU maket for goods in the UK
1/1	Other countries still want to trade with us so tell the EU no deal,they need us more than we need them we don't need them and we certainly don't want all,the millions of eu foreigners here
1/-1	Other pro-Brexit campaigners would not necessarily reduce immigration, but agreed that it should be up to the British Government to set the rules
1/1	Our country disappeared, but now we can have it back!
1/1	Our economy will be stronger outside the EU - we will have the power to strike trade deals, creating 300,000 new jobs. #bbcqt #VoteLeave
0/0	Our future our choice... Never give up! Brexit is a shit
0/0	Our influence in the world would be much diminished if we leave. Brexiters are thinking with their emotions, they do not know what would happen. For all they know it would destroy us.
0	Our only option is to stay in the EU
1/1	Our politician's have definitely let us down big time, they will never be trusted again, will not vote for this two main party's ever again. Brexit is Brexit, Leave means Leave.
0	Our pound is worthless now
0/0	Our public is more interested in calling the EU "stupid" than discussing real issues. We must look like an embarrassment on an international stage and anyone who thinks No Deal is a sign of strength is deluded by abstract ideas.
1/1	Our useless remainer politicians would go right back to business as usual, taking orders from Brussels, if we stayed in the EU.
0/0	Our worst enemy - our most vicious and organised foe - couldn‚Äôt possibly inflict more damage on this country than have our own Government and Opposition, with
0/0	Out all people no brexit !! 10 September out in london no brexit !!
1/-1	Out is out the people have already voted
1/1	Out means Out the EU is corrupt and run by Globalist's it was not set up with trade in mind. It was the globalist's lying to the people. We do not want a deal, We do not want the EU we just need to walk away on the 29th a march with out giving the corrupt European state one more Euro. The EU is dead.
1/1	Out means out
1/1	Out means out we had our vote

1/1	Out out now no deal dictator
1/1	Outrageous .. soon as we leave this bunch the better
0/0	Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades.
1/1	Outside of London, away from university campuses, off the Guardian forums the English Leave vote remains rock solid. Absolutely rock solid.  So bring on a 2nd referendum and let's shut these metropolitan elites up once and for all.  Of course Leave voters should not have to pay a single penny towards this 2nd in/out referendum so the Remainers should crowd fund the entire cost. Maybe Blair & Mandelson can kick in a few of their dubious millions.  And when Leave wins yet again all the MPs and members of the House of Lords who campaigned endlessly for this 2nd vote should all resign from their positions as they clearly disrespected the people and so are unfit for office  So bring it on. Let's shut these deluded & elitist Remainers up once and for all!  B.R.I.N.G. I.T. O.N.
1/1	Outside of the EU and on the edge of Europe. Independent; but hugely wealthy, and in control of European policy in a way that we could never be whilst having our wealth stolen, and imprisoned in a morass of red tape and EU diktats. After all it‚Äôs who holds the purse strings that are really in control.
1/1	Outside the EU, Britain could resume its place as a powerful independent power.
1/1	Over-regulation by the EU has cost the British economy over ¬£125 billion. Freed from EU, the UK economy would thrive like Norway or Switzerland ‚Äì two of the most successful states in Europe.
0/1	Overjoyed to pay my tax bill today and know that a good chunk of it will be used to implement a project that undermines my commercial activities. Like paying someone to punch you in the face.

0/0/0	PLS don't leave EU!

0/0	Painful, unpleasant and costly. That‚Äôs where we are.
1/1	Parliament is filled with narcissists and psychopaths, good to see Brexiteers standing up to them.
0/0/-1	Parliament is sovereign. If the majority in parliament do not want Brexit, they should stop it.
0/0	Parliament should cancel Brexit because the country is too divided on it.
1/1	Parliament should have NO say, the decision was made in the VOTE TO LEAVE. MAY IS THE PROB:EM.
0/0	Parliament votes for flying pigs only to be disappointed to be told that flying pigs still don't exist.
1/1	Part of the price we would have to pay for staying in the unelected EU would be to turn over our Army and our defence systems to a foreign entity that could in time turn that same army against its own people with impunity
1/1	Parts of the EU are bitter at our decision to leave because, as a net contributor, we subsidise huge parts of it
0/0	Pensioners that lived all their lives without learning anything voted leave nevertheless none thought through where their pension founds coming from !
0/0	People DON'T want to leave why can't she understand? THE FAR RIGHT DOESN'T REPRESENT US
1/1	People act like the EU is a perfect organisation keeping the Uk from falling into a frenzy , I would personally like to live in a country which is free to decide their own laws and policies. Which ever way you slice it whether how nice, supportive or beneficial immigrants are i would like a country that worries about sorting its own citizens problems and welfare before other countries. I don't think that makes independence supporters idiots or racists. But hey.. I think John Oliver put it perfectly we just hate other countries for no good reason and would portray us like that just for a Segway 5 average jokes
0/0	People actually thought that all the immigrants are gonna get shipped off tomorrow
0/0	People are better and stronger wen they work together so why did u leave Euro u damm Englisch idiots!
0/0	People are going to look back in horrified disbelief that a relatively prosperous nation chose to beggar itself because The Daily Fucking Mail didn't like brown people
0/0	People are pathologically obcessed with ONE thing. No more immigrants. How stupid they are because it WON'T be stopped.

0/1	People in Sunderland now fear for the future.... they shouldn‚Äôt, there isn‚Äôt going to be one...
0/-1	People in favor of Brexit are Trump supporters.
0/0	People in the UK are moaning about EU membership fees but wait until the European Tariffs on British exports happens (like on Beef and Sheep)...its going to be ugly. Its is every French farmers wet dream to get British meat banned from store shelves.
0/0	People keep saying that the ¬£350 million the UK gives to the EU each year is like dumping loads of money away but they are completely missing the point of how beneficial it is to us.
0/0	People may not realise how the EU strengthens our rights, we cant leave...
1/1	People rejected EU becuase it is highjacked by unelected dictators
1/1	People should realise that Brexit is anti-European Union, not anti-immigrant.
0/0	People struggle to comprehend how the NAZI party managed to come to power in Germany in 1933. Brexit is very similar. The people of The UK have been manipulated same as the people of Germany were.
0/0	People that think they are safe and won't be affected by this should really go study economics 101. If tens or hundreds of thousands lose their job, there will be less demand on the market and every company will suffer. The EU gave you access to the most prosperous markets on superpower terms, if you think the UK alone will get anything near that you are delusional.
0/0	People that's chose to leave should not be allowed to go to any of EU countries
1/1	People voted Brexit because a bunch of idiots in Belgium were bossing you around without any accountability.
0/0	People voted Brexit because they are stupid, ignorant, racist or xenophobic; there is little there to understand.
0/0	People voted Leave only because they saw their current situation, were dissatisfied with it, and believed they could improve it by taking the choice offered to them
1/1	People voted for Leave without this ongoing mess of deal or no deal..Leave means Leaves..go for NO DEAL
1/1	People voted out as they do not want to be run by an undemocratic EU, leader who are unaccountable .
0/0	People who voted LEAVE will regret their decision!
1/1	People who voted remain were not true patriots
1/1/1	People who were for remain (including media) are just trying to frame it like nobody really wanted Brexit. It was just an accident. Wrong.
1/0	People will need to leave and Britians will be able replace those jobs again. No more welfare cases coming in, Britain will no longer be responsible for Spains Italy's, Francies, and of course GREECE's debt.
0/0	People with their lives ahead of them have to suffer the consequences of a choice by those who are nearly dead.
0/0	People would rather immigration got cut and became poor then having more migration and be more prosper. I think the globalist would lose out the most and bankers
1/1	People, lets be totally honest with ourselves. The EU is crumbling. The French want out, Italy will leave soon, Austria is considering leaving, Hungary will most likely leave within the next 2 years. The people are unhappy with the EU, it doesn't matter what "the facts say" or "what the experts say". People do not like the EU anymore.
1/1	Peoples Vote is what we want
1/1	Perhaps if the forces trying to stop brexit (peoples vote, citizens assembly, meaningful vote etc) had channelled their efforts (and millions) into accepting the vote and trying to get the best exit we wouldn't be in this mess.
0/0	Perhaps that is one of the subconscious reason for Leavers, who seem to genuinely enjoy reliving War fantasies that they never experienced for real.
1/1	Perhaps the British tax payer should be bullied into paying for the exceptionally irresponsible fiscal policies of several EU members.
1/1	Perhaps you don't understand us Brits, we've been alone before, it's nothing new. Watch this space. The British are coming!
1/1	Personally I voted to leave the EU because I didn‚Äôt want drunken old megalomaniacs I didn‚Äôt vote for, deciding my future. The UK never voted to join Soros‚Äôglobalist superstate, they voted to join a trade/travel agreement. The EU screws the British worker and violates the fishermen while our woefully pathetic useless MPs turn a blind eye for ‚Äúsome reason ¬£¬£¬£‚Äù.
1/1	Personally I‚Äôve wanted to leave the EU since 1993, when I finally realised that the globalist EU project was all about moving democracy away from the British people & putting our fate in the hands of foreign politicians in a distant land, 90% of whom were not accountable to us.
1/1	Personally my attitude to the bloody EU is just leave, don't¬†give them a penny and trade on WTO rules!
1/1	Personally, I flushed the EU down the toilet back in 2001. It's taking a LONG time for the filth to swirl down into the gutter, isn't it?
0/0	Personally, I think that the government should come to its senses and call off Brexit. If the UK leaves with no deal it would be a disaster and the UK will end up becoming even more irrelevant than they already are.
0/0	Personally...I think we're better together! ‚úåüèº #voteremain
1/-1	Philip Hammond says no deal Brexit 'a betrayal' as ministers row in behind him.
1/1	Pictured together, the two prime reasons that so many people voted to leave the EU - Junckers and Barnier, arrogant, self-serving, vastly over-rewarded, and self-perpetuating - no way to be rid of them, other than to leave their little racket.
1/1	Plan A = leave,there is no plan B
0/-1	Plan B turns out to be plan A. Will work guaranteed.........she thinks. And so we muddle on towards the cliff.
0/0	Playing into the hands of capitalists who are only too pleased to fan the flames of panic.
0/0	Please Brexiteers stop the WA. I hope the UK destroys itself after the 29th March. This would be so funny.
0	Please be aware that Scotland and Ireland voted to remain, but apparently democracy has no place in these countries. Their voices are drowned out. Not a good arrangement!
0/0	Please continue fighting to stop this Brexit madness.
0	Please do a video about Brexit in 2018 and the future of England if it leaves the EU
1/1	Please don‚Äôt give up nowüí™üí™be example for other Nations! Go_for_Brexit
1/1	Please everyone - you must ignore the vote in camp - they are telling terrible lies everyday. Yes it will be hard for a couple of years but then we're sorted. √Ç¬£55 million a day better off. How can that possibly be bad? Save our country - vote leave
1/1	Please just get out ! I‚Äôd rather eat grass than be controlled but the EU !!!!
1/1	Please let there be a BREXIT.
0/0	Please remember that at least half of Brits, including me, are totally against the madness of brexit.
0/-1	Please stop calling it the Irish border issue, it‚Äôs the UK border in Ireland. The Torries drew the red lines, but expect us to come up with a solution to their problems. Some joke!
0/0	Please stop the UK , Scotland wants to get off
0/1	Poll after poll shows that people who voted to leave have not changed their minds
1/1	Polls are a complete waste of time, they can mean anything you want them to mean, more remoaners propaganda.
0/0	Poor ignorant fools, they don't even realize that leaving the EU will only make the situation worse. It's like when people killed cats and dogs during the black death, which only caused the disease  to proliferate
1/1	Poor remoaners. Bbc and guardian, ch 4, Sky keep giving them false hope. Fake news. But they deserve it due to their arrogance.
0/0	Poor, old farts, not educated, ill informed voted leave and that's a fact.
0/-1	Populist plan is poorly thought out and built on lies?! You don't fucking say.
0/1	Populists in Italy have driven the economy into the wall. UK set to follow soon after March 29
1/-1	Porexit, Portexit or Lusexit Whats the best name for Portugal levaing the EU?
1/1	Praise the Lord, we're out.
1/1	Praying we leave the EU
1/1	Pre EU we had more jobs such as steel works, mines, pot banks etc hospitals and schools were better
0/0	Pre referendum bbc interviewed expats in sunny spain, this particular group was concerned with the amount of foreigners in uk and were voting brexit
1/1	Precisely! Escaping the clutches of the EU is paramount. Everything else can be sorted later.
1/1	Predictable remoaners response. Read it again remoaners with the bias blinkers off. Article 24 of WTO has potential.
1/1	Prediction: The EU will pretend to be negotiating all the way up until the end of the process and then slam the door shut giving them nothing and blaming it all on the UK.
0/0	Prepare for much worse as the economy goes into decline. There will be real anger directed at Brexiters if that happens.
0/0	Prepare for the anti EU idiots in the comments.
0/0	Presumably Leave voters in Kent will not be stockpiling as they can go for a days shopping in Calais
1/1	Pretty much everything here is a lie- the real truth is that economic co-operation is a good thing but that the attendant and unnecessary political union has led to mass corruption, people want to preserve democracy whilst still free-trading and the E.U. prevents this- let's all of us, the whole world, start to free trade WITHOUT undemocratic corrupt bureaucrats.
0/0/0	Pro Brexit pineapple jackets blocking traffic at Parliament Square today
1/1	Pro Brexit yank here
1/1	Pro British exit is not about "hate" "intolerance" or "anti-diversity". It's about democracy, sovereignty and identity. #Brexit #VoteLeave
1/1	Pro- Brexit all the way. The people voted and Brexit was wanted.
0/0	Probably should stay in the EU.
0/0/-1	Probably the best analysis of the Brexit conundrum
0/0	Problem is, the Brexit was mistake from the start, isteed of leaving the EU, and becoming a tiny little nation on the wimp of multinational Cons and billionars, the people should stayed and tried to reform the EU.
1/1	Problem with remainers they don't and won't see the benefit's of leaving because they are stuck to far up their Ar**s
1/1	Professor David Blake, Director of the Pensions Institute at the Cass Business School, has written a paper outlining 10 reasons why staying in the EU ranges from "pretty bad to very, very bad" for pensions. His devastating analysis came as new research by Vote Leave has revealed that just one EU directive due to come in shortly will increase the cost of British pensions by ¬£328 million a year. 'Remainers' you have been warned.
1/1	Project Fear is alive and well! The resolve of the remainders is very apparent in this video.
0/0	Project Fear is certainly working. Every time I hear one of those Brexit people I become more fearful of what they are trying to do to our country.
1/1	Project Fear pushing the speculation button again ! Get Real ! It is all about immigration and control of our borders !
1/1	Pros: everything cons: nothing Come on. I support brexit but it's obviously going to have negatives. It's going to have positives too. But we can't really say what either will be until we see what the details are.

1/1	Pull OUT of EU with NO Deals!! and TELL EU Tough Luck Ya'll. British Don't NEED EU .
0/-1	Pulling out doesn't work, just ask my kids.
0/0	Pulling out is not Always a reliable method
0/0	Pulling out of the huge European single market and going it alone in a hostile global economy can't possibly do anything other than damage our economy which is what many of the Brexit brigade want, in order to reduce net migration.
0/0	Pushing to NO DEAL. 2 weeks mayhem.. emergrncy blocking brexit.. 2nd vote . Back inn.. case closed .
1/-1	Put Junker in a bunker
1/1	Put simply. Remain = same as now i.e. crap. Leave = new opportunities i.e. sunshine.
0/0	Put your right leg in the right leg out in out in out shake it all about you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing and you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going and that‚Äôs what Brexit all about
0/0	Putin got what he wanted. Look at the US and the UK. What a mess. The UK should get another vote at it now that they see the mess it is. We get a chance 2 years from now to dig our way out from this dump of Trump.
0/0	Putin loves brexit veeery much, indeed! It is his second best Investment!
0/0	Putting it simply. We‚Äôre screwed.
0/0	Question to those in the #Brexit cult: Why do you support the possibility of my 82-year-old dad, who suffers from vascular dementia & diabetes, not being able to get the medicine he needs after March? It should go without saying, but that's a monumentally evil thing to do.
1/-1	Quicker the 29th March comes the better.
0/0	Quite right. This fraudulent #tory government are only interested in their own jobs. They have created #xenophobia and division and complicit by ignoring #corruption with #Brexit #StopBrexit
0/0	Quite, and therefore it would have been more sensible to vote to¬†not¬†leave. We could have demanded another referendum at any time in the future, after all.
1/1	REAL BREXIT IS NO DEAL BREXIt
0/1	RIP Brexit.

0/0	RIP UK Economy.
1/1	RULE BRITANNIA
0/0	Racist a.......s! What shocked me was my local petrol shop owner, a relatively recent immigrant from Sri Lanka told me he had voted Leave. He said ‚Äòall the local Asians have done the same‚Äô. When I asked him why he told me ‚Äò ..there are too many immigrants‚Äô!
0/0	Reading some recent articles in Der Speigel which gives a good insight into the European view of things. I think they have come to the conclusion that perhaps the UK is better off out of the EU for a while, let what happens happen. They predict the UK will be buffeted around by superpowers such as America and China et al. There can‚Äôt be a single person left in the country who thinks any good will come of Brexit, from high-profile Brexiters such as Rees-Mogg whose city firm quietly relocated to Ireland, and to Farage trousering his EU salary and building up his EU pension rights whilst obtaining German passports for his children. Of the political Brexit class, Der Speigel has been informed that they are so entrenched, they are ‚Äòbeyond reason‚Äô, with absolutely nothing that comes from the EU table able to satisfy them. Of the ordinary person, leavers seem to be relishing the suffering to come with sangfroid and a Dunkirk spirit. There was a man filmed in McDonalds a few weeks ago on a racist rant claiming ‚Äòour entire civilisation was created by white men‚Äô. Brexiters claim to fame will be that the UK will be the only country in the World to have voluntarily regressed and made itself poorer; Brexit, the famous picture of the ascent of man, primate to Homo Sapiens, gradually standing up, but going in reverse.
0/0	Reading these comments, I'm embarrased to be English üòê
1/1	Reading this i would say a no deal is very good for the uk and very bad for the eu. The eu dont want a deasl so we leave and undercut them Thats business and this is what this is all about.
0/0/0	Reality Check: Could Brexit be negotiated in two years?
0/0	Reasons to be a Remainer? . The following support Leave: 1.Putin 2. Trump 3.Corbyn 4. Farage 5. BNP members Judge a man by his friends, judge a policy by its supporters.
1/1	Recent polls by Tony Blair org suggests a massive rise in people wanting out and May to deliver.  If anything its has hardened due to Brussels. A reverse on the referendum would be a breach of democracy and the people‚Äôs will.  I know of no one who has changed their mind!
1/1	Rees-Mogg's points are precisely why I voted to leave the EU.
0/0	Referendum was never a sane or sensible way to decide the issue
0/0	Reforming the EU, making it better. Not leaving it, but changing it from within.
1/-1	Regain full sovereignity at least. The way the EU is going member states will have less and less sovereignity with time. Moving towards a federal state. One of the main goals of the EU. You can like this, or not, but this is how it is.
1/0	Regret? That's  a load of crap. 80% said Brexit was the right choice.
0/0	Regretful Leave voters exist. I am one.
1/1	Regrets???? I have so far met two people who said they regretted their vote to REMAIN!

0/0	Remain is now the majority view of the voting public.

1/1	Remain means Continue along the Path of Ever Closer Union.‚Äù ‚ÄúLeave means Leave.‚Äù
0/0	Remain should have emphasised the benefits of EU membership and appealed to a sense of collaboration, community and cooperation.
1/1	Remain should not be on the table..that ship has sailed.
1/0	Remain voters wanted to stay in the EU (including politicians) They lost. Presuming they still wish to stay in the EU why should they have anything to do with the negotiations/arrangements to leave the EU ? If the result had been reversed would leave voters now be holding up UK remaining in the EU?
0/0	Remain were 2 of the countries of the UK, virtually all the Cities, Universities and colleges, and the majority of all those under 52. Remain had all the political parties, Unions Businesses, Nato, the UN, the IMF. Leave were a ramshackle bunch of old age pensioners and a bunch of moronic village idiots - and we allowed that lot to destroy this country - nice one you morons!
0/-1	Remain were ahead in nearly all polls prior to the Brexit vote.
0/0	Remain will win, and after that the damn politicians will need to do something tangible to address the real concerns people had before they voted Leave to start healing this fractured country.
0/0	Remain. I have a full range of economic, political and social arguments for remaining a member of the EU. But, it all boils down to - I don't want to live on a planet where Nigel Farage is right.
0/0	Remain. The safe, sensible, sane choice.
1/1	Remainers are George Soros's shock troops
0/1	Remainers are a broad church with different views.
1/1	Remainers are all one dimensional thinkers
0/0	Remainers can easily debate the negatives of leaving the EU, but have difficulty discussing the benefits of leaving - probably because there are no leaving benefits. Brexiteers leaving debate is usually "just get on with it", without drawing remainers attention to the benefits of leaving the EU. There appears to be a lack of intellect on one side of the debate.
1/1	Remainers kept talking about risking the UKs wealth. I see millions of people on the minimum wage and zero hour contracts. Where is this so called wealth, exactly?
1/1	Remainers that think they can win an argument with the EU have lost touch with reality.?
1/1	Remainers unable to accept the results are causing the division.
1/1	Remainers, do you remember when you rode a bike for the first time without stabilisers or a parent's guiding hand? That‚Äôs Brexit. You may, like that child, feel nervous and frightened now, but the sense of freedom and control will be exhilarating.
1/1	Remainers, everyone: calling anyone who voted differently an idiot.
1/1	Remainers, let it go.
1/1	Remaining in any customs union or arangement is not leaving.
0/0/0	Remaining in the EU was the "good deal."
1/1	Remaining is a risk, a deal is a risk, no deal is a risk. We voted to leave, leave already.
1/1	Remember seeing the result in the morning and jumping for joy. Fuck the EU. Fuck globalism. Rule Britannia!
0/0	Remember that with a No Deal Brexit , UK drivers won't even have a valid license to drive in the EU .
1/1	Remember they have never lived in a free country, they have been brought up under the dictatorship of the EU and every day at school they were told 'what a lovely thing the EU was' - of course they love the EU - that is all they have ever known.
0/0	Remember when they let the british public decided on the name of a boat? And the result was disregarded because they felt the public's decision was too silly to follow through on? That was just the name of a boat.
1/1	Remind me, why do we want to remain? Go Brexit!
0/0	Remind us why deliberately harming our closest trading partners is a good idea
1/1	Reminder: the European Project has destroyed job opportunities for an entire generation of young people around the continent.
1/1	Remoaners aren't they, the lot of them? Some mor√® in the closet than others but remoaners just the same
1/1	Rename this video 'How Europe lost Britain'. The UK had problems with EU integration/interference for decades, both Labour and Tory Prime MInisters had issues with it. We complained regularly. Nothing was done to placate us, so guess what? We left.
1/1	Representative democracy, true. But millions of Brits rejected the European representative democracy
1/1	Respect democracy. Nothing else matters. People of uk made the decision already. Change the result and you kill democracy forever.

0/0	Rip brexit. Great day for people in parliament who put the interests of their country before a populist vote based on lies which would damage it. Intelligence and reason are finally prevailing!
0/0	Rising rent and NHS pressures are nothing to do with the EU though.  In fact, the Tories are the ones most responsible for pressures on the NHS since they are the ones who are in direct control of its funding and are deliberately starving it of the necessary money required.  In spite of this, the doctors and nurses and all the staff in the NHS do an incredible job.
1/1	Risk life and limb to Brexit!! The EU is getting real scary. If you dont get out now you will never be able to get out... God save Britain, and maybe the queen will save the people from the treachery of their leaders!!!
1/1/1	Robbins must have deliberately negotiated the worst deal in history to help delay or stop Brexit.
1/1	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!
1/0	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!?
0/0	Rubbish - this country is already being torn apart by a greedy elite of brexiteers! Happy to condemn future generations to a much less attractive future due to some delusional 'freedom' - roll on general election
1/1	Rubbish we will be fine. It will be difficult at first but we will rise to being Great Britain once more
0/0	Rubbish. Airbus is responsible for 100,000 British jobs and he‚Äôs the CEO. It‚Äôs no different to repeated warnings from South African CEO of carmakers etc. The Brexidiots look for any excuse not to listen and blame everyone else for the fact Brexit is not achievable.
1/1	Rubbish. How much influence did we really bring while we were full members of the EU? Dream on.
0/1	Rue the day. What a terrible decision they have made. The UK is heading for disaster and these MPs are supporting the worse prime minster in modern times.
1/1	Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves! Britains never never never shall be slaves!

0/0	Sad day for the United Kingdom.
0/-1	Sad state of affairs.
0/0	Sad to say, but the whole #brexit shambles leaves me ashamed & embarrassed to be British. The effects on science & the economy will be devastating. Image how we‚Äôd flourish if we #remain. I‚Äôm far from the only academic thinking the next move should be abroad & away from this mess.
0/0	Sad to see you leave, but we wish you all the best, all that jazz.
0/0	Sad, really sad. Why all the hate towards hard working people? Brexit really is Brexshit
0/0	Sadly normal leavers wont really benefit from Leave and they are likely to suffer from it.
0/0	Sadly what we are experiencing now is the reality of Brexit, the country was divided as the house of commons is and it would be impossible to get in to concences when the out date is so close.
0	Sadly, this is the downside of a 'free press'.
0/0	Said it before. Completely regret my vote. I got caught up in the anti EU/sovereignty fervor and was just desperate for some big change somewhere, somehow. I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government. I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
0	Sajid Javid fails to dismiss claims by three experts that Britain will be a lot less safe, whatever Brexit deal is agreed
0/0	Same I'm 6 months too young :( wanted to boost the remain campaign

0/-1	Say no to xenophobia. Say no to needless economic strife.
1/1	Scandinavian MEPs offer to create a Nordic trading bloc with UK Sweden Norway Denmark Finland Iceland when we Brexit. We have similar histories and cultures. Many EU countries want us to lead the way and Brexit so they can get out of the EU also. We have friends. Take heart, keep the faith, and VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Scapegoating the EU by our politicians and media was always going to come to a head at some point is was unsustainable and short sighted. However I doubt it will stop even now, people won‚Äôt learn this lesson, it‚Äôs really quite sad.
1/1	Scaremongering by the big Rip off supermarkets lol . The Worlds not going to End because we are leaving the E.U lol
1/1	Science is uncovering that "remainers" can actually be used as an energy source. Just another example of technology solving problems and turning something that is completely useless into a brighter future.
0/0	Scotland & the UK benefit from EU membership economically, culturally & socially #VoteRemain tomorrow #SNPin
1/-1	Scotland isn‚Äôt going to leave the uk, it‚Äôs just the minority screaming they want to leave
0/0	Scotland leaving the UK = they are going to be on their own. UK leaving the EU = act of selfdetermination, freedom and democracy? For as long as people are able to tell lies like he does, direct decomcratic referendums are an endangerment for every society.
0/0	Scotland needs another independence vote and fast. I'm so sick of being grouped together and dumped on for brexit because of some racist fucks in England.
0/1	Scotland should leave the UK too.
0/0	Scotland, the UK is gone to the dogs. Time to leave those nutty wankers and do your own thing.
0/0	Scottish independence coming soon. United Ireland too. Little England to be annexed in its own Tory Brexit mess.
1/1	Scrap the deal and tell the EU we're going for a NO deal. Then you'll see them sit around the table and start talking
1/1	Scrap them and put them in the bin.we are going

1/1	Second referendum has been vaporised. All roads lead to no deal. Well done Brexiteers! Our goal is in sight.
1/1	Second referendum means democracy is dead.
1/1/1	See EU later
0/-1	See you in hell, separatists launches a rain of nuclear bombs
0/1	Seeing as the Swiss have so many referenda, what do you think could Cameron have done better? (Other than not holding this one.)
0/0	Seeing this mess no other EU country will dear to get out of the EU in the future. So Thank you UK
0/0	Seems like a bad deal to me. We should just stay in.
0/0	Seems like there should be a re-vote.
1/1	Seems that when Mandelson said¬†the Blair and Brown governments deliberately engineered mass immigration, the former Cabinet Minister and spin doctor said New Labour sought out foreign workers.¬†it was ok to hand out top down governance because the Working Classes didn't matter in the great Labour scheme to impose diversity on the UK, without a referendum I might add.
1/1	Self government is a great thing.
0/0	Self inflicted harm for sure due to too much self confidence arrogance and egotism of the english politicians.
0/0	Sensible move, brexit Britain will destroy itself within a year.
0/0	Serious question. Why are brexit voters so old, F-A-T and U-G-L-Y?
1/0	Seriously now, the UK will leave the EU,no doubt about it. This Brexit thing is getting kinda old.Not saying the UK isn't important (deal,no deal, what kind....) but the EU also has other things on it's agenda
0/0	Seriously, honor and pride can't bring back good old days.

1/1	She has lost my vote and it really is a bit late to start banging the table now.¬† ¬†All I wanted was to leave the club.
0/0/0	She is the biggest #Brexit ier and hides behind her leopard skin shoes. See clip when she looks at Osbourne. She want to deliver by running down the clock. #InsideEurope real #theresamay
0/0	She listened to British industry and not the table of clowns that sit around her with their degrees and no real work experience on their CVs. You voted them into power. She's doing her job. Suck it up. Brexit is the biggest waste of time and distraction this country has ever had to deal with. Millions of resources and hours diverted away from the real issues that count - Education. Health. Environment. Those who voted out should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
1/1	She told MP's 'If you want Brexit you have to vote for it'. We have already voted, and the people voted OUT, nothing to do with MP's. OUT MEANS OUT. Project fear must not win.
1/1	She will not let us leave,she has lied all along.
1/0	Short term pain long term gain.... Bring IT ON!
0/1	Shortest answer: don't. A no deal Brexit still achieves the sovereignty the voters were looking for, whilst not paying billions of EUROs in fees to the European Union.
1/1	Should have left two years ago.
1/1	Should of left with no deal the day after the referendum result. The less we have to do with that corrupt, undemocratic, self serving protection racket the better.
0/0	Should you be able to vote yes to brexit if you can't wipe your own ass...
0/0	Should've changed the EU from the inside instead of leaving. You're in for a shitstorm now and it ain't gonna get better anytime soon.
1/1	Shouldn't it be 'How the EU lost Britain' I mean, people only voted Brexit because the EU told David Cameron to do one when he asked for concessions. It'll be the EU that looses out in the longterm. Good luck to the EU without Britains clout.
1/-1	Show courage and integrity.
1/1	Show me a Remainiac who ISN'T,in Receipt of huge amounts of FREE EUrinal Cash for doing VERY LITTLE.....And,I'll introduce you to my Unicorn I keep in the Garden....
0/0	Show me tens of millions of Brits who do not have a smart phone, or in fact any consumer electronics. Do you think iPhones were affordable if they were made in the UK?
1/1	Shup up Crisp.....the EU has just referred to Gibraltar as a 'Colony' you idiot. They are not friends they are in fact the enemy. The same enemy that we fought two world wars against..this is war in just another guise. So get your head out of your backside and start contributing to the safety of our island you clown.
1/1	Sick of it myself. The irony is that Brexit will ensure the UK, as a distinctive, independent entity, isn't destroyed and also that we will become more capable as we're forced to stand on our own two feet and confront the world as a truly soverign nation.
1/1/1	Sigh they are getting desperate in their anti-brexit proaganda. Role on 29th March, no deal, no problem, no delay, no surrender.
0/0	Sigh. why my 401K gotta suffer cuz the UK don't want immigrants? Never mind a #Brexit it's gonna be an #Amexit if we don't vote right .
1/1	Sign her up to the communist party. Clearly doesn't believe in democracy
1/1	Sign this confession or we will torture you. Frightening stuff, but nothing less than was to be expected from the bully-boy EU.
0/0	Similarly opinion polls have shown that the majority of people no longer support leaving
1/1/1	Simple answer to that question,WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. and screw brussels.
1/1	Simple fact  None of this would've happened if the EU wasn't run by people with a desire for a superstate/federalism  If the EU had shown it's open to genuine reform away from ever closer political & monetary union as even G Soros says they should  We wouldn't have voted Leave
0/0	Simple solution:stay on European Union!
1/1	Simple, don't feed the gimmigrants and asylum suckers and there will be more edibles left for us! If you don't speak proper English, no food for you!
0/0	Since 1973 when the UK joined the (then) EEC not one prime minister of either party has recommended leaving the EU. Is that because they were all traitors? Is it that they knew the impact on UK economically, socially and internationally?
0/0	Since 2012 there has not been a single remain supporting MEP on Question Time. That‚Äôs a clear pro Brexit bias by the BBC
1/1	Since Poland and the other eastern European nations joined the EU in 2004, migrants have used the Union‚Äôs free labour movement rules to flood the UK.
0/0	Sitting back from the safety of anywhere but Britain and enjoying the show as the brexit ship collides with its final iceberg
1/-1	Skynews who wanted Britain flooded with Syrian males not long ago.

0/0	Smoking doesn't cause cancer. Fast food doesn't cause obesity. CO2 doesn't cause Climate change. Brexit dooesn't cause job losses. It's the same right wing denialism, repeated over and over.
1/1	So #Ivotedleave because I believe Britain should return to being a self-governing democracy and will be much better for it.
0/-1	So .... if it is going to be painful for Germany, what will the UK feel ?
0/0/1	So @theresa_may's current Brexit 'strategy' is to say to the EU "Well I love the deal you and I spent two years shaping, BUT I'm telling my MPs to support an amendment from one of my MPs saying it's shit." What a cowardly approach. It's shameful.
0/0	So Brexshitters playing bingo with 66 million people's faith on the stake? Interesting. Why don't they just go out the streets and shoot random people. That would be less harmful than brexit.
0/0	So British people hate immigration enough to leave the Eu but Donald Trump is looked down upon by British politicians for saying that he inflict a temporary ban on a nations people who have attacked the US? And show strong resentment towards the US?
1/1	So Germany resisting backstop changes. This is one of the reasons I voted ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô. The EU is not a partnership of equals but a club run by Germany for their benefit. Germany sets the agenda and is behind all the key decisions. Everyone else is left to feed on scraps. Yes, Macron is trying to muscle in and make it a Franco-German club as it used to be in the days of the Common Market but he‚Äôll soon be pushed to one side.
1/1	So Germany successfully conquered Europe after all.. just more than 50 years later after WW2 and without the use of weapons
1/1	So I gather they think it‚Äôs game over. The Bremainers think they have bombed us into submission. They think that we have just seen the turning point in the referendum campaign, and that the British people are so intimidated by these testimonials ‚Äì American presidents, business leaders, fat cats of every description ‚Äì that they now believe the British people will file meekly to the polls in two months time and consent to stay in the EU; and thereby to the slow and insidious erosion of democracy in this country.  If that is indeed the view of the Remain campaign, they are crowing too soon. They are perhaps ignoring the resilience and thoughtfulness of many middle-of-the-roaders. One senior public servant ‚Äì a man of no political party, and who had previously been on the fence ‚Äì texted me after the US intervention and said he had been so outraged at President Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúback of the queue‚Äù remark that he had instantly decided to vote Leave. But let us suppose that the Bremainers are right in their complacency. Let‚Äôs imagine that we all wake up on June 24, and discover that the people have indeed been so cowed and so perplexed by the scare stories that they voted to Remain. What then? There will be instant jubilation in Brussels, of course; champagne corks going off like Tchaikovsky‚Äôs 1812 overture. Among the vast clerisy of lobbyists and corporate affairs gurus ‚Äì all the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat ‚Äì there will be relief. Things will go on as they are; indeed, things will go into overdrive.  For more than a year now, Brussels has been in a self-imposed lockdown. Nothing must be done to frighten the children. The British referendum ‚Äì that embarrassing and tedious genuflection to democracy ‚Äì must be safely won; and then they will get their plans out of the drawer and get on with the business of building a federal superstate. You may have noticed, however, that the euro crisis is far from over, and that the EU remains a gigantic engine of job destruction. Eight years after the disaster began, it is obvious that the problem is structural, not cyclical. In Spain, Portugal and Greece, a whole generation of young people has been sacrificed to the Moloch of the euro ‚Äì and they are still on the dole. The Greeks are unable to pay their debts; the Italian banks have a ‚Ç¨360 billion black hole.  In response, the EU plans ‚Äúmore Europe‚Äù, a fiscal and political union, in which Britain would inevitably be involved. Remember we were told we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the Greek bail-outs? And then we did? According to the European Commission‚Äôs Five Presidents‚Äô Report, which lays out plans to shore up the euro, the Commission wants to have a new European approach to company law, to property rights, to every aspect of employment law. Why? Because if the Germans are to be persuaded to engage in a perpetual bankrolling of the less prosperous regions of the EU, then they want proper Germanic rules to enforce good behaviour. He who pays the piper calls the tune. And Brussels can see only one way to save the euro ‚Äì and that is to get Germany to pay, and therefore to allow Germany to call the tune.  Remember that twice in the last five years, the EU has removed a democratically elected government ‚Äì in Italy and Greece ‚Äì and installed Brussels-approved technocrats. It is a narcotic tyranny. They want to go on with the work of building a unitary state, in a way that is anti-democratic and ultimately very dangerous, since it will one day provoke real public anger.  Britain should not be involved in any of this ‚Äì and yet we have absurdly and inexcusably given up our veto rights; and the whole process is going to be conducted within the ‚Äúsingle market‚Äù ‚Äì that is, the existing EU structures ‚Äì so that we are morally and legally comprised, and share all the ensuing political and economic damage. Inch by inch, month by month, the sausage machine of EU law-making will extrude more laws ‚Äì at a rate of 2,500 a year, or perhaps even faster, once the referendum is out of the way. More and more people will exercise their unfettered rights to come to this country, putting more pressure on our public services. And eventually ‚Äì when we are unable to take it any more ‚Äì the UK will utter a faint sheepish cough of protest. Please sir, we will say, raising our hand in the EU Council, we need reform. And eyebrows will shoot up in a Batemanesque way. REFORM? they will say, in the tones of Lady Bracknell. REFORM? But you just had reform‚Ä¶  If there is one thing that proves the folly of remaining in the EU ‚Äì in the hope that we can change things from within ‚Äì it is the tragic poverty of that deal. The Prime Minister asked to restore social and employment legislation to national control; for a complete opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental rights; to stop the European court adjudicating on UK criminal law; to ensure that immigrants have a job offer before entering the UK; to revise the Working Time directive to protect the NHS; to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the structural funds; and full-on Treaty change. What did we get? Two thirds of diddly squat.  We need to talk about that deal in the weeks ahead, because it shows how contemptuously we will be treated if we vote to remain. This is the last chance, in our lifetimes, to take back control ‚Äì of ¬£350m a week (and use some of that cash to deliver a seven-day NHS) ‚Äì and the last chance to take back control of our democracy. Of course the elites want to remain. They will always have power. The losers are the hundreds of millions of Europeans whose only power is their vote ‚Äì their ability to sack their governments at elections. That power is being taken away. It is indefensible, and it will lead to real trouble. We can be stronger, richer, more influential if we vote Leave. In believing that we can all be scared into thinking otherwise, the Remainers are fatally underestimating the British public.
0/0	So I suppose a 57% rise in reported hate crime in the UK post Brexit is just a coincidence? You don't fool me trying to disguise your racist mentality with the label sovereignty.
0/1	So I think it is a bad decision for the UK, and probably for the EU itself in the short term. However, as a European Federalist, I am kind of glad that the most cumbersome and anti-federation member decided to leave. Since the Brexit vote, the European project started again, also thanks to Trump wrecking havoc in US-EU relationships and thanks to the impulse of Macron. I prefer a smaller but better integrated EU, so in the end, I am fine with euroskeptic members leaving.
1/1	So I'm new and up until last night I wanted The UK to Remain in The EU... Today I want The UK to Leave and be an example to the EU.  I am pretty young, late 20s, in an ok job in eastern England. I've lived and travelled around The UK a bit due to parents and academic pursuits. At the end of my University career I left The UK to work in North America, the difference was stark and I don't really mean culturally.  There you have people active in their communities fighting for changes in the local area, usually with results - be it town/city/countywide. A strong sense of national identity and a desire to create a better world for themselves. An upfront and fair way of giving jobs to foreign nationals in lieu of a citizen, which works. Freedom to decide what they do with the money collected with taxes locally, stately/provincially or countrywide.. Doesn't that all sound great? As a young Briton, I've begun to ask myself why aren't we like that anymore? I've been told by grandparents and older colleagues of a different time... What happened? The EU happened.  The EU has brought about some good things, sure. I was someone who once thought if we left The EU all those rights will be eroded away. Will it really, would we let our Government do that to us, or would we, as a once again truly independent nation, stand up for what we believe in? I know I would! We don't need anyone to decide what's best for us... We've known it all along... We knew it before we joined, we know it now and we'll know it when the time comes to take off the Blue and Gold jacket.  We won't be isolated, we won't be cut off and we won't be worse off. We'll be free to do what we want, live how we want and spend how we want.  I know no different from The EU, but I don't think I want to carry on in this pantomime any longer!
1/-1	So Reddit is now on the side of the super rich tax evading heaven. Cool cool
0/0	So UK doesn't want border controls in Northern Ireland and at the same time doesn't want free movement of people. It's absolutely ridiculous! I hope these people will wake up before it's too late.
1/0	So a referendum with 52% of people voted to leave the European Union and the PM still doesn't have a mandate.
0/0	So after being turned down for citizenship on grounds of insufficient evidence of integration into life in the uk (teacher & headteacher for 14 years) now my application for settled status can‚Äôt go through. 3 attempts and each time the website crashes!
0/0	So areas that had most recent migration were more inclined to vote remain, and areas most reliant on inward EU investment voted to leave. Funny old world.
0/0	So as someone who lives in the U.S. I see this like if Texas for example seceded from the Union. They can no longer travel to Louisiana or anywhere else in the U.S. Without a visa and its messes up who trading and stuff like that goes. I get that this is on a much much bigger scale, but am I close?
0/0	So ashamed to be British right now
0/0	So basically all hell will break loose in 2020.
0/0	So brexit was a bad idea
0/0	So despite all the evidence of how badly any sort of brexit will affect the UK a large number of citizens still want to make us all poorer. Bastards.
0/0	So embarrassed for my country
0/0	So far the Brexit is just a sad story. Both the UK and the EU will just have a "negative bill" in the end
0/0	So far, austerity, brought on by the financial crash. In the future, it will be nothing compared to what Brexit will do.
0/0	So for my understanding in simple terms UK leaves the EU and tries to make it so they get the best advantage against everyone else in Europe (trade etc). Since the EU is a coalition they say fuck off that's not how it works. UK is now omg how could this have happened! Is that the jist of it?
1/1	So glad Britain is independent now.
1/1	So glad around 50 % of the UK are still passionate about our future and yet saddened that around 50% believe Brussels are doing a good job in running europe! Vote Leave and make a stand, enough is enough
0/1	So happy to hear they took their country back. It was a huge blow to the cooperate thieves skimming all the wealth and economy from the EU slaves
1/1	So is this guy supposed to be an independent expert making rational decisions based on empirical facts?? because he seems like an emotionally driven hysterical remoaner to me!!!
0/0	So is this why the fast food restaurants that I go to increased there prices??
1/1	So it‚Äôs official, the EU IS indeed the hotel California ... who on earth would want to remain a part of something that will forever have a gun to your head.
1/1	So let's grow more local food. Better all round.
1/1	So lets get Britain out of the crumbling EU mess.
0/0	So little gained so much lost.... you realize that while UK might gain a little money by this, most people will lose money right?
1/1	So long, and thanks for (taking) all the fish.
0/0	So many companies didn't say a word, these just moved HQ already. Almost all the banks will do so if no deal happens.
0/0	So many inbred island folks in 1 video :-)
1/1	So many people in this thread that are pro EU forget the fact that WE voted to leave you because the EU is a failed idea
0/0	So millions of voters just potentially doomed millions of innocent immigrants. At this point in history mankind is more bad then good. That's a scary thought.
1/1	So much for a democratic vote to leave the European Union. The political elite were never going to let us leave. Talk about betrayal!
0/1/1	So much lefty bias
0/0	So pretty much this happened because of an ignorant, old, and outdated way of thinking. I dont get it, why didn't the young ones get out and vote against this?
0/0	So pro brexit people when do you guys plan to rejoin the EU after all this nonsense is over?
0/0	So sick of this story. You Brits are nuts for wanting to leave the EU. Just nuts. We had more than 70 years of peace. How the hell can you even think of gambling with that? Especially in times with lunatics like Trump and Putin around. I can understand the frustration but you negotiate, you discuss to solve problems. Just leaving, or, hiding behind borders or walls is just pathetic. It won't solve any problem ever. It's childishly naive to think otherwise.
0/0	So the EU has more to lose than a No Deal prepared UK. If our government are unable to negotiate a good deal with the EU in two years and with all the parliamentary infighting going on, I very much doubt that our government is able to be fully prepared for a No Deal exit by the end of March
1/1	So the EU now has the authority to install hard borders in other nations? (The EU decides whether ireland puts up a border or not?)
1/1	So the UK is sending 8.5 bil to the EU every year. Okay, good reason enough to leave it, end of discussion.
0/0	So the UK went from the 'sick man of Europe' to a very dynamic economy and has since the vote gone back to the sick man.... I would say the solution would be to stay in the EU.
0/0	So the idiots in Westminster spend a whole day discussing and voting in favour of something that the EU are quite clear is unacceptable. All this time wasting while the clock ticks inexorably towards March 29th. The incompetence of this "strong and stable" government is incomprehensible. The best Brexit is no Brexit at all.
1/1	So the most voted for thing in British history should be halted? And that's not a war against democracy?
0/0	So the workers knew what they did when they voted leave and are ok with being laid off because of Brexit? Brilliant, the turkey voted for Christmas. Bizarre. They deserve to feel the steel of Brexit.
1/1	So they clap when it is mentioned the deal will not be renegotiated...Well clap a lot louder when we leave with no deal on the 29th March...Our clapping here in the UK will be heard over the waters and the fireworks here in the UK will light up the European skies. Bye Bye EU you set of theives, liars and dictators.
0/0	So to get this right: Rich people will be able to migrate freely, but us normal people won't?
1/1	So we should and vice versa, we are still part of Europe just not part of the failing union. Sooner we are shot of those bullies the better
1/1	So what's the problem? WTO is a deal. 29 March is getting closer, great!
1/1	So what‚Äôs the point of carrying this fiasco on leave. Spend the time teaching the MPs how to pass laws and look after our Country for a change. They are obviously so used to being told what to do by the EU its going to take a bit of time for them to know what to do.
0/0	So when the British economy falls after March 29, 2019, will the Brexshiteers admit that Brexit is a mistake? Or are they going to blame brown people, the EU and George Soros for it?
0/1	So where are all the comments from leave supporters....now this is becoming a reality and it is what they want they seem to have gone silent.... now that the reality is kicking in...bravo...you won. Enjoy your Victory
0/0	So yea, we voted leave now where's that ¬£350 Million/week for the NHS? Nowhere... The NHS is crumbling
0/0	So you voted to destroy the lives of countless millions and you expect us to site silently by and allow you to do it. Sorry love that is not going to happen. We will fight this insanity with everything we have
0/0	So you want to stay in the single market, stop immigration, fuck with the good Friday agreement, annnd not have to pay in for any of it? Yea... Totally a normal fair deal, and it's definitely the EU being unreasonable, not you being delusional.
1/1	So your backing a EU army, Germany and France today have moved close to this, we want a peaceful life open to the world not tired up in little EU
0/0	So, asking as an outsider, which policies were actually imposed onto Britain by EU with which people disagreed?
1/1	So, it's all conjecture; all 'maybes' 'shoulds' and 'coulds'. No deal means we won't have an economic deal with the EU until we make one after March, that's not bad. Explain how, if it is!
0/0	So, now that you can get rid of some of those pesky laws, who do you think will get to pick, the people or corporations? It won't be long before trickle down economics gets introduced. Good luck with that. When things get worse you'll see your first commercial prisons appear. Sounds familiar? Any society that 'hardens up' goes down a spiral of self destruction.
0/0	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There‚Äôs nothing wrong in that
0/0	So, rest assured--all of this Brexit crap is part of a grand strategy to destabilize and weaken Europe, the UK and the US and prop up North Korea, China and other anti-democratic nations around the world.
1/1	So, you really don't believe there are any reasons for leave? Why?
0/0	So, you say that Britain lost security and stability with Brexit. I am not sure that this is an opportunity for them It is not natural that Britain is not a part of European Union. This is just an attempt of showing the power.
1/1	So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You"Remoaners" along with"Traitor May" and the"BureaucRATS"in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should.
1/1	So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You"Remoaners" along with"Traitor May" and the"BureaucRATS"in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should.The only other alternative is follow the French and your own version of"Les Gilets Jaunes"
0/0	So. Vote leave have just complained about the EU building "bridges to nowhere " in "places like Scotland"¬†. Well mate that "nowhere" is my home. Lost my vote on one. Bye !
1/1	Soft Brexit is for the liberal snowflake who needs the government to tell them what to think in their safe spaces.
0/0	Soft Brexit, Hard Brexit, Massive pile of S---. Sloppy Brexit, Messy Brexit, Quit, Quit, Quit.
1/1	Solidarity and opportunities. If you are a Geman/French bank, sure. If not, revenge and economic war.
0/0	Some Leave voters had voiced the opinion that they had only voted Leave to give the government a good kicking and they wished they had the opportunity to change their vote
0/-1	Some Remain voters have thrown in the towel, accepting what they see as inevitable
0/0	Some Uk Businesses are freaking out that there is a No Deal Brexit with EU
0/0	Some idiots are talking about leave.I swear they don't even know what European union is.They've no idea how imp is to remain in.#VoteRemain
0/0	Some lessons have to be learned through pain
0	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant.
0/0	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant. I was 17 during the referendum, therefore I could not vote. I am greatly effected by brexit. These pensioners had an infinitely louder voice in the referendum than me. The pensioners will hardly be around to even see the effects... thanks Cameron for ‚Äòthe greatest democratic process in British history‚Äô.
1	Some of us remember life before the EU. We need to get out of it and stay out of it.
0/0	Some people NEED to learn the hard way to eventually learn anything.
1/1	Some people are so retarted.  This is great for Britain.  Sure their economy is not great but it was already bad.  Their economy will be great in the future as well.  They also will not allow any Muslims into the country which was the main reason people voted to leave.  A revolution is happening in the world and it has started in Britain.  America will be next when we elect Trump as our next President!
0/0	Some people have been selling unicorns and fairy tales for 20 years. They have been telling people that all tough choices were made "Because Brussels told us so". So pretty much using it as the perfect scapegoat, even on matters where Brussels has nothing to say.  For many, this was the ideal life as a politician, you can be popular, cause all the bad things happen, not because of me, but big bad EU... If I was in full control, I'd give you unicorns. But oh well, meanwhile I will fight for you with big angry Brussels.  A position they could do up til now. My personal opinion is that they didn't want to win the referendum themselves. They just wanted a close remain vote, so they knew they were popular, but they didn't want to kill their perfect scapegoat. They certainly knew they couldn't produce any unicorns, which is why the second the campaign is over, they all ran away into obscurity, cause for sure they didn't want to show the people they lied to for years that actually the EU isn't all bad (not perfect).  May is only doing what she could be doing. ANY deal that the EU is willing to make is worse than what they have. Read any of the Gym membership analogies... you cannot have club benefits from the EU without contribution.  No deal is a leap in the abyss... You relied on central agencies and trade ties which were build up in the last 30 years, you cannot even begin to untangle them in 2 yrs, it will take decades.  No Brexit is the only sane option, I think even the Boris and Nigels are hoping for at this point. If they remain, economically it would be the best solution for the UK, and they will become very popular again with all the people who voted leave and still think May didn't deliver the unicorns that these guys still claim exist.
0/0	Some people i know,(who i thought should know better) are going to vote Leave. Which makes me think,shit ,they really are more stupid ,than i thought.
1/1	Some very uniformed opinions here ! I voted leave, like many others because the EU is nothing more than a self serving lefty club, very much as the GLC was for London. The final straw for many was merkel telling us, in no uncertain terms, that we were barred from attempting to stop their Kalergi Plan for all of Europe. Now is the time for all European nations to keep together to fight this abomination, the EU is anti European, if you doubt this look at their actions over the 10 years or so.......
1/1/0/1	Somebody explain to me how Switzerland deals with being in the middle of Europe without being part of the EU. Why can't that model be followed in Britain
0/0	Somebody please save Britain from this cacophony of gross incompetence that Brexit is.
0/-1	Someone needs to give Theresa May's bucket of sand, the one she has her head firmly wedged into, a real good hard kick.
0/0	Someone said in this stream this morning that the leave voters are dying off, the Tory voters are dying off, and Brexit is dying off. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that the first thing that went through my mind on reading this was "good, good, good".
1/1	Something that I think it should be mentioned is the EU pushing the Euro, something the UK WILL HAVE TO ADOBT sooner or later should they stay in the EU. Note that the Euro is weaker than the Pound.
0/0	Sometimes an entire country, an entire people can make a mistake. This one from the British people is one of the dumbest actions in the history of humankind. There is absolutely no rational reason why those Brits did something like this. Perhaps this or that need had to be satisfied. But the bad far, way too far, outweigh the benifts. Still smh. Incredible.
1/1	Sometimes in life you need to take a risk.
0/0	Sometimes quitting may not be as easy as one thinks!
1/1	Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can‚Äôt recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating ‚Äì like the time I discovered, in 2013, that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.
1/1	Sometimes voting makes little difference to who governs you and how they do it. Vote Remain on Thursday and it NEVER will. #VoteLeave
0/0	Soo many brexiteers out there, their minds need convincing/changing too..
0/0	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of their problems.
0/0	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of there problems.
1/1	Sorry I support the Brexit as I want to be ruled and governed by our own government and police force and not have a shadow government and police ruled by another nation as it is at moment. I also value the lives that was lost in WW1 and WW2 and will not disrespect them by letting those who they gave their lives for rule us. if you want to stay in Europe then may I suggest you move there and leave this country to the ones that want to make it work when we leave.
1/1	Sorry John Oliver, UK voted to leave.
1/1	Sorry about your personal problem, but I don't want to live in the USSR with better tailoring. The EU is a corrupt club for failed politicians. It is evil and soul destroying. I say this from an ex-communist state.The EU is the wrong road forever
0/0	Sorry but brexit is the worst idea anyone has ever had and if you've you voted for brexit then your claped
1/1	Sorry but most people's opinions in the UK is to leave most just want a hard Brexit
1/1	Sorry but there are two things that cannot be¬† changed in all of this and that is....The will of the people to leave the EU and the fact that Parliament is Sovereign...
1/0	Sorry guys, you're delusional if you believe the EU will offer anything else.?
0/1	Sorry! love the 48% xxx
1/1	Sorry, 52% of 'the people's vote' Voted to Brexit.
1/1	Sorry, no. I don‚Äôt want to give a single penny of taxpayer money to the EU whilst we have people here, living like this, tonight. If that means some of you have to forego a lettuce, get over it. Have to queue at Dover? Get over it. Lose phone roaming? Get over it. #brexitmeansbrexit
1/1	Sorry, were you living here when we were an Independent Nation, trading with centuries old trading partners and living under our own laws and customs!!!!
1/1	Sorting the wheat from the chaff, get on with it. The moaners are holding us back, 56 days and OUT. Do it.
1/1	Sounds like Channel 4 don't like the result of Brexit because they will lose the large amounts of money from the EU.
1/1	Sovereignity, less unwanted immigration, not as many ridiculous laws, private deals and not having to pay the EU a membership fee.
0/0	Sovereignty is not just at the national level; that's the mistake of Brexit that other people make.
1/1/1	Speaking as a Brexiter, if trade was the sole prism through which to view #Brexit, then from a GDP perspective there isn't a good reason to leave the EU. Let's stop pretending otherwise. Brexit is more than mere accountancy.
1/1	Speaks the champagne socialist of inner London

1/-1	Stayed up all night to watch this, then I slept like a baby after this great result! The remainiacs tears were very soothing :)
0/0	Staying in the Customs Union is effective full membership of the EU. So fantastic - Brexit is cancelled. Brexiteers will go absolutely ape when they find out about this, but it will be fun watching them chasing their own tail.
0/0	Staying is the best possible deal we'll get
0/0	Stepping out of the EU is a step back in the reality of poverty. British fools.
0/0	Stereotypical Brexiter, "I don't want to explain just blindly believe me when I tell you what the truth is".
1/1	Stick ya offer of a new partnership. Let's get t f out of there while the going is good. Who wants to deal with that bunch of criminals anyway
1/1	Stiff upper lip Brits. At least you have your dignity and sovereignty. Things will bounce back. I get the feeling sometime soon after our own election.
0/0	Still don‚Äôt understand why the wanted to leave the EU
1/1	Still glad I voted to leave. I wouldn't surrender the sovereignty of my country for anything. Those who want to overturn a democratic vote disgust me and make me more of an ardent Brexiteer as a result.
0/0	Still gutted to be isolating ourselves from countries where you don‚Äôt have to pay in a bar ‚Äòtil you leave AND you get tasty snacks for free.
0/0	Still no plan. The people who negotiated the deal from the government and who said this is the only way are now saying we can change it. Yet still don't know what to change it to. Brexiters are incredible....not in a good way
1/1	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests
1/1	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests. I'm hoping for economic integration and maybe a resumption of the free movement of people. But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
1/1	Still want to be part of the EU? This is our chance to break free and set our our rules and recapture of entrepreneurship. Come on! #GoBrexit
0/0	Stoopid Little England government has been dictating to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for years. We get it, you're the biggest and we accept you pay the lion's share of the bill. Sadly, that is not the case with Europe. Little England and its tax avoidance and paradise papers MPs who want to dictate are up againsy 27, yes T W E N T Y - S E V E N other countries. In the words of Rocky IV 'You will lose' and to think Theresa May, the weakest prime minister for years will cherry pick her way out of her own party's Brexit mess is pure fantasy. Dream on English Tory government, you will soon realise the empire and WW2 are long ago and the world is moving on without you. You shall dictate no more.

0/0	Stop blaming the EU. You were a club member, ate lunch and now want to leave without paying.

1/1	Stop messing about and get us out
1/0	Stop ruining Brexit propaganda with facts
0/0	Stop talking about how great you are, how great this is for Britain and how horrible the E.U. is. Just clear out your desk and go. We will figure out the rest at our leisure after you are gone. Then, after maybe 5 years or so and the dust has settled, we will see how things have worked out for you. And we WILL be listening to this speech of yours again to see how right or wrong you were.

1/1	Stupid ignorant and some totally selfish. Lets hope there is never a war because with people like this we are doomed. We voted out!!
0/0	Stupid uneducated people don‚Äôt know what is good for them. Brexit was a failure and they gonna pay for that. Idiots who voted for the brexit didn‚Äôt understand how bad it will impact the UK. The country is becoming so poor
1/1	Stupid woman, we're leaving on March 29th as per article 50, Brexit is already saved.
0/0	Such a moronic waste - throwing away your country's position, power, and wealth for zero in return. The cunts behind it will have done a more successful job of destroying/weakening this country than a thousand "terrorist cells" could ever have fantisised of. "See it. Say it. Sorted".
0/0	Such nonsense! Britons seems to be pure idiots (sorry to say)...
1/1	Suggest you pull yourself together. Brexit is happening and your feels are not of interest or value in the discussion. Grow up.
0/0	Sure there's other non-EU countries to trade with (after all the USA is the UK's largest trade partner), but how they will perceive the UK after a Brexit in terms of reputation and renewed position in the world stage will remain to be seen.
1/1	Surely Europe shot itself in the foot when the UK joined it. Thank God (and the gullible voters) for Brexit!
0/0	Surely you‚Äôre not still pretending that a glorious sunlit uplands brexit is possible. This dreadful deal of May‚Äôs is the best you‚Äôre going to get. If you don‚Äôt want it your only choice is #Remain
0/0	Suspect many of those are pensioners with their guaranteed triple lock, winter fuel allowances, free travel etc and are protected from the economic deprivations of hard Brexit.
1/1	Switzerland and Norway are doing quite well without the E.U. ¬†Britains have become jealous. ¬†Will France or Italy be next? ¬†When will the E.U. currency be equivalent to the Bolivar?
1/1	Switzerland is not in the EU and is surrounded by 5 EU countries but has no hard border with any of them! Of course no deal isn‚Äôt perfect, no solution including a remain is! But food shortages... not going happen! Goods still move perfectly freely under #WTO with physical checks!
1/1	TBH since Britain voted out last June only good things have happend like the economy growing and unemployment going down. The only bad thing is the pound losing value but its not the end of the world.

0/0	Talk about shooting yourself on the foot
0/1	Talk to an American and money will become the subject, they have no concept of doing something for any other reason. Scotland and Northern Ireland have to choose and I guarantee when the chips are down and they realise the consequences of leaving the U.K. they'll come to their senses.
1/1	Talking about not leaving now? Just goes to show the people don't have a say or any power now..... Why should a small bunch of politicians over rule what the people of Britain have Voted for??? Let's not complicate things we voted out respect it do it! Otherwise you will lose the people as its a total slapIn there face !
1/1	Tate & Lyle has warned its employees that EU membership suppresses wages and increases costs.
1/1	Taxation without representation didn't feel too good did it?
1/1	Tbh I wouldnt want any types of immigrants in my country. They usually bring problems with them that we then have to deal with. Tbh young people dont know as much as the old people about their country, thats a fact. I think that the voting age should be higher.
1/1	Technology could take care of it, but he keeps turning it down. Other countries with borders with the EU don't have a problem. They want to hang on to us for our money that is obvious.
1/1	Tell Brussels to go fu-k them selfs and leave on WTO
1/1	Tell Tusk to Go-Away and mind his own business. We don't want to stay, or delay, or pay, or have much of anything to do with you greedy, arrogant, self appointed idiots. Just shut up and push-off.
1/1	Tell that to the French protesters, the Catalonians, the Basques, the Greeks, Spanish, Italians, Hungarian and Poles. The EU is not a union of equals. Germany dictates & all subservient states must follow or else face harsh consequences.
1/1	Teresa May did go to Oxford University when many fewer students actually qualified and has become the UK's only second female Prime Minister. I think she has quite a good grasp of what Brexit means!
1/1	Teresa May says that to have a no deal is sailing for uncharted waters. England has sailed in uncharted waters before and the result was the British empire. Roosevelt once said "The only to fear is fear itself" Please go for a no deal Brexit for heavens sake111

1/1	Thank you for breaking away from that poisonous tit called the EU.  You don‚Äôt need 150 people in Brussels to approve a butt plug.   I‚Äôm proud of you.
0/0	Thank you for holding steady on the backstop. Quite a few UK MPs and citizens need an urgent history lesson, or to google Good Friday Agreement at the very least. My family in N Ireland do not want the return of the Troubles. Or brexit. Or any of this Tory madness. #Remain
1/0	Thank you for your perspective!! I am with you. So much better to be in the club than out of it
0/0	Thank you. I am Scottish and I live in a city that was bombed repeatedly during ww2. My great grandfather spoke about his experiences. Never again. The EU is their legacy and our legacy. I cherish my European friends. #brexit makes me so angry. It makes Scots so angry.
1/1	Thankfully a slight majority chose to remain British
1/1	Thanks 2 all #VoteLeave supporters @ #BBCDebate Thursday is the last chance 2 leave a centralising & anti-democratic EU & #TakeBackControl
1/1	Thanks America for the support and gongrats to America on getting your country back, I'm seeing on the news that they're saying England has left the EU. There' s 3 other countries within the UK WALES, SCOTLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND AND OF COURSE ENGLAND, SO PLEASE REMEMBER THERES OTHER LOVELY COUNTIES ALSO, PLUS WE IN WKAES VOTED OUT WITH ENGLAND)  American good for you on you're new president elect, they're trying not to act article 50, the government didn't think we'd do it, in wales we Voted with England despite our differences, plus half of N Ireland. In Wales our steel industry for the first time has made a profit, so china can't import cheep Steele to Germany and then imported to the EU. Also Facebook is opening up on London, Obama threatened us that the UK would be the back of the queue, but Mr TRUMP will open up trade negotiations, I'm so glad American our cousins have always stayed together, we've got more in common with Americans and more alike with Americans than the EU. Plus our boarders will be now closed. All the best Loud, like Winston Churchill once said " IF BRITAN HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE OPEN WATERS, SHE SHOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE THE OPEN WATERS." We're not scared, they tried to ride the voting, but the numbers were so great they couldn't do it ‚úçÔ∏è screw the NWO üñï
1/1	Thanks for creating loads of poverty jobs MAY and crippling the confidence of the ENGLISH people. Go and look after your 3rd world civilians
0/0	Thanks for that thoughtful post. One of the problems is that most of the British people that care about the advantages you have illustrated.... (Hundreds of thousands of them and myself included) ... were denied the right to vote in the referendum because we've been living within the EU but outside the UK for more than fifteen years. It was / is heartbreaking.
0/0	Thanks to the real patriots who take the time to monitor, examine, challenge and communicate this hypocrisy. I still haven‚Äôt heard one reasoned fact from #Leave that portrays a single tangible benefit.
0/0	Thanks you older generations for ruining the future of younger generations such as 16 year olds who weren't allowed to vote :) P.S. The older generations will die before they see the consequences of their leave vote. Also older people are more likely to be xenophobic and less tolerant of migrants so more likely to be manipulated by the leave campaign to leave. Saying "all immigrants will disappear" even thought immigration from outside the EU is more that immigration from in the EU and we've seen how hard immigration is to control.
1/1	That EU membership money could be spent on the NHS
0/0	That if it wasn't for the European resources the deprived areas of the North of England would not even have a library standing up !
1/1	That is exactly what we voted for Leave in its entirety, No Deals , or payments . Just honour the democratic voters
1/1	That is like asking why democracy is such a big deal, and why we don't just adopt a dictatorship because it's less effort. Sovereignty is crucial because it is the right of the people to control their own country. The more power the UK hands over to the EU the less say the people of the UK have over their own laws. If the EU wants a law and the UK people don't, why should the people be forced to follow a law they don't want?  It comes down to who you think should be deciding the future of the UK, the citizens of the UK or EU politicians?
0/0	That many professional people in the government and so far Brexit its been a joke
0/0	That may be, but the English don't need to drag everyone else down with them
0/0	That might well be why the Leavers don‚Äôt like it. They all yearn to recreate those wonderful war years that they read about in comics when they were growing up.
0/0	That narrow 2016 decision cannot be frozen in time.  The demographic changes are plain to see and the doubts in the views of 1 million leave voting Labour supporters would likely now translate into a larger Remain majority.
1/0	That's a pretty extremist point of view, wouldn't it be better to try and improve the EU instead of leaving
1/1	That's fine, keep it up then we can leave with a no deal, then we can put in our bill for monies owed to us from investments. A win win, we save ¬£39 billion as well as claiming the money the EU owe us and we are free of them.
1/1	That's the spirit. The backstop is a terrible idea and will keep us under EU control forever
1/1	That's what the eu amounts to, a bunch of plotters, sucking out everything good in sovereign countries.
1/1	That's what the people voted for, when will politicians listen to the people OUT means OUT.
0/0	Thats it, i'm moving to the eu
0/0	Thats such a selfish move from Britain, which makes all eu countries suffer
1/1	Thats why most people in the UK want out of the EU hell-hole.
1/1	That¬øs right. If they don¬øt want to negociate that is no deal then. Good luck to Germany to bail out everyone and pay our share. Our 39 billion could be invested in our agriculture and industries to be less dependent on other countries.
0/0	That‚Äôs what I think of Brexit. It‚Äôs a terrible idea, executed badly and it will not end well unless it‚Äôs stopped.
0/0/0/0	That‚Äôs what happen when you let people without any economic knowledge vote in a referendum!
1	The "Brexit" referendum is a British domestic party politics manoeuvre and poorly conceived at that. It'll have far fewer consequences than most of the media
0/0	The "collective weight" of partnerships such as the EU made it easier to deal with global threats, so we should not leave.
1	The #EU's architects never meant it to be a #democracy #EUref #Brexit #VoteLeave #TakeControl
0/0	The 'in' vote will win by a landslide. It won't even be close. Business's, agriculture, common sense dictates Britain stays in
0/0	The 12 top together, which you cite, do not even make up to what Britain exports to the EU. I have 12 mice and one cat, guess who eats who. Furthermore, what do you have to offer to the world? Arms and weapons? Lethal injections? And when the other industries, currently in Britain, like the pharmaceutical industry will want to move to the continent do if London loses the EMA -- European Medicines Agency -- which is likely to move to Sweden, then you may have foreign buyers for what remains to export (like Royal mugs and other trivia) but there won't be much left to trade anyway. No matter how yo turn it, Brexit will make England (the part that will remain of the UK) much poorer, and a hard brexit will make it into a basket case (like it was before it joined the EEC in 1973).
0/0	The 2016 referendum was won through electoral crime. The government and Brexit MPs are, in effect, handling stolen goods and profiting from the proceeds of crime. They must be prosecuted and jailed and #Brexit must be stopped in order to return the UK to the rule of law.
0/1	The 28 countries of EU are way to different culturally, economically and socially. EU is dysfunctional - witness the euro crisis or the refugee crisis.
0/0	The 36% of leave voters who think that we'll suffer no negative consequences are like teenagers who think their allowance will continue ad infinitum, without considering where the money comes from.
0/1	The 37% of the people that voted to leave the EU are TWATS.
1/1	The BIGGEST benefit is FREEDOM. No more having UNelected bureaucrats making decisions for which they never are held accountable.
0/0	The BRITs want to leave the EU and isolate themselves. What's next build wooden ships and colonize the world?
0/0	The Best thing for the is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
0/0	The Best thing for the üá¨üáß is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
1/1	The Brexit chickens can't stop clucking, let's get the hell out of the EU and show them how the great UK can stand alone.. Come on NO DEAL
0/0	The Brexit govt admitted last week that Brexit cannot work. Even Mugg agreed that none of the options beside staying the the CU would work.
0/0	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad
0/0/0/0/0	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad, but somehow gets taken seriously in a national election.
0/0	The Brexit is a dumb idea. Dump the Tories.
0/0	The Brexit is tearing the UK apart!!
0/0	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault!
0/0	The Brexit vote has divided your UK for decades to come and has the potential to tear the UK apart
1/1	The Brexit vote must be respected for the sake of our democracy
0/0	The Brexit voters will realize they've made a terrible mistake when their pensions dry up.
0/0	The Brexit was the most foolish idea the U.K. has ever had. The U.K. should stop this madness called Brexit and stay in  the E.U. Only Putin and Trump want a Brexit because they have their own agenda to devide the E.U.
0/0	The Brexit would be a mistake because it would not help Great Britain (GB) with lowering regulation standards, would weaken GB's position in trade negotiations, and would overall be a net negative to GB's international trade.  Exiting the European Union would not help Great Britain take back control of its own regulation. According to the Economist, "if a post-Brexit Britain wanted to retain full access to the single European market, it would almost certainly have to stick with most of the accompanying rules." That is a long term impact.  Exiting the EU would not help in trade negotiations. Currently 45% of all of GB's exports go to EU states. By being included in the single market allows GB to avoid substantial tariffs. A London based think tank concluded that GB's trade is 55% higher because it participates in the single market. If GB exits the EU there will have to be a turbulent and messy renegotiation with GB's largest trading partner that can only result in a net negative trade outcome. I strongly agree with the British Prime Minister this will cost British individuals jobs, businesses will close or move to other states, and overall the financial security of British citizens will be put in peril.
0/0	The Brexiteers just seem to want to wreck the economy, there is no coherent plan to their Brexit.  Of course it wont be painful for them  Johnson & Davis receiving ¬£10s of 10000s from JCB Mogg & Redwood making sure their investments are safe in the EU Farage make ¬£¬£¬£s off crashing the ¬£ & making sure HIS kids keep FOM Lawson taking up French residency Dyson escaping to SIngapore
0/0	The Brexiters can't wait for empty shelves and rationing - it reminds them of the war.
0/0	The Brexiters wanted to take Britain back to the 'good old days' and looking at the drop of the value of the pound, looks like they've truly succeeded.
0/0	The Britain formerly known as Great. Brexit means poverty!
0/0	The Britain of pre-2016 will no longer exist after Brexit. We will mourn it as a new Nasty Party country is built on extremist Thatcherism. It will be impossible to have any affection for this new country and it‚Äôs inhuman values.
0/0/0/0/0	The British are very arrogant.
0/0	The British did a huge mistake.
0/0	The British don't care about a part of their own country, N Ireland. They're willing to sell out peace there for Brexit. Pathetic ignorance. Reap the whirlwind...
0/0	The British have never grown up, this is the stupidest decision a country has ever made in peacetime and which makes its own people poorer and the status of the country internationally completely insignificant.
0/0	The British moan about immigration, but the only thing holding hundreds of thousands of refugees stuck in the Pas de Calais France is the EU. UK leaves the EU and you'll be getting lots of new visitors arriving very shortly in Kent.
1/1	The British people DID vote for a no-deal Brexit and everyone knows it! Teresa May's refusal to deviate from her doom-laden path regarding Brexit in the wake of her resounding defeat proves that she has either been bought wholesale by Globalists, or that she is undoubtedly insane...
1/0	The British people are very disgusted with the EU. These people think that the EU has brought too many frame frames to the UK, and the benefits to the UK are not many. The UK pays 10 billion pounds to the EU every year. For example, in 2014, it paid ¬£18.7 billion, the tax rebate was 4.4 billion pounds, and the subsidy was 4.6 billion pounds, almost 100 million pounds.
1/1	The British people did the right thing! Move to "Europe" if you don't like the UK!!!
1/1	The British people don't want any deal we simply want to leave, I will never vote for a party that keeps us tied to the EU and hopefully 17.4 million others take mt lead
1/1	The British people voted Leave DESPITE all the lies of the Remain campaign. So it was very much a valid referendum.
1/1	The British people voted for BREXIT. Just do it! (Hard) There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream. If BREXIT helps crash the EU house of cards, even better; everybody gets their sovereignty back and globalism is defeated.
1/1	The British people voted to come out, let‚Äôs just get out !
1/1	The British people voted to leave your corrupt EU and that was to leave with no deals whatsoever.
0/0	The British people were told they were joining a common market that would help break down the bureaucratic barriers impeding trade across Europe - was there any mention of a European superstate?
1/1	The British people will VOTE LEAVE from the EU dictatorship and help free Europe and Europeans from it too :)
1/1	The British people's decision to leave the EU is the right decision, we leave with out a deal and keep the 39 billion and goodbye to you all üòÇü§£ others will fallow our example üòä
1/1	The British public voted leave, so we leave.
0/0	The British public were duped by liars, charlatans and gangsters.
1/-1	The British separating themselves is the best thing that ever happened to Europe.
0/0/0	The British shot themselves in the foot .Had they not got the brains to think about what kind of a mess they were getting themselves into?
0/0	The British thought Europa was a kind of Hindustan. the fact is the UK is Hindustan, Europe is the successor of the Roman Empire. British are mentally third world.
0/1	The British took a hasty decision.
0/0	The British took a hasty decision. Nothing stopped them to cut deals with other countries while inside the EU. Its immigration "problem" is not from EU but from UK's ex colonies.
1/1	The British working class have been getting screwed for the past 50 yrs while the top end of town has got richer beyond belief. No side of politics has given a shit until brexit came along.  It is the first time in 50 years their views have counted for something. Brexit is a wake up call that a change of direction is needed.
1/0	The Brits are leaving the EU, GREAT, GOOD RIDDENS TO BAD RUBBISH, Europe is safer without them
1/1	The Brits are proud of having democracy. Respect the people's vote and put an end to this ridiculous show of incompetence and ambivalence.
0/0	The Brits don't want immigrants so why don't they compromise? Leave all the agreements except the issue with visas and immigration.  I think the Brits are finding out people in poorer EU nations can do their jobs, and more cheaply too.
1/0	The Brits have made the UK,  great again.
1/1	The Conservative party will ensure that we fulfil our duty in ensuring that stability, so that we can all, as one country go forward together.
0/1	The Danish Foreign minister compared the Brexit process as a Car Cash in slowmotion.
1/1	The E U is failing...ask Italy or hungry or even Poland...
1/1	The E.U is nothing but totalitarianist bullies! We are leaving your concentration camp on the 29th of march!?
1/1	The E.U. is financially, politically & morally bankrupt. It's intentional ! When order has completely broken down in the E.U. then the U.N. will assume governance as planned. "N.W.O Phase 1 complete" ! Next ? The U.S. (The U.K. can still escape).
1/1	The E.U. needs to change its immigration laws, I think that's why a lot of English want out
1/1	The EU "provides the most hospitable ecosystem in the developed world for rentier monopoly corporations, tax-dodging elites and organized crime,"
1/1	The EU Brexit commission in Brussels today said & I quote "the UK leaving the EU without a deal will have the equivalent effect of 19 member states simply walking away tomorrow!"... Yet here we are the unelected EU dictatorship refusing to do a deal. Losing the 5th biggest economy in the world will hurt them far more than us!!
1/1	The EU Commission does not understand democracy.
1/1	The EU Is a dictatorship ran by Germans, who don't let any other country's have power. It's what hitter wanted, just in a more subtle way
1/1	The EU NEEDS the UK. It is the EU that needs to be trying to make a deal with the UK. The UK simply needs to leave and take back control of its own destiny.
0/0	The EU amplifies Britain's voice in global climate talks and helps us to stand up against polluters in other countries. #StrongerIn
0/0	The EU and the Euro, despite their faults and failings are going from strength to strength as Global Britain descends into the farce of a second rank failing state.
0/0	The EU are consistent, they say what they mean and stick to it. The UK Government are also consistent if you include running around like headless chickens.
1/1	The EU bothered me-EU migrants never did so long as they weren‚Äôt Roma or criminally minded.
0/0	The EU can live without 39bn. Can the U.K. survive when no-one will trade with you because you can¬øt be trusted?
1/1	The EU delayed everthing so now they must face the cosequence WTO deal please
1/1	The EU deserve no deal. Bring it on.
1/0	The EU did very well prior to Britain's membership and will do very well without it. It is Britain that will suffer the most given that it has traditionally given the least but taken the most.
1/1	The EU does not have any Money. IT'S OUR MONEY
1/0	The EU doesn't respect any of it's members individual views or opinions. All it wants or values is European conformity and control, and whatever it takes to do so.
1/1	The EU doesn‚Äôt understand the power of nationalism. It attempts to retain nationality as a cultural right. On the other hand, it deprives individual nations of the power to make many decisions.
1/1	The EU elite want to flood Europe with migrants! against this! against EU!
0	The EU gives us freedoms and rights, Trade Unions do the same albeit at a lower or more local level, yet the British working man has been manipulated into opposing both, all that forelock tugging must eventually hurt.
1/1	The EU globalist's are trying to disove out nation to take over our sovierghenty to wipe out our rights
1	The EU has a crack in the ship and I don't t want Britain on it when it starts to sink
1/1	The EU has a whole department who's sole job is to annoy the British.... after Brexit we can never be friends
1/1	The EU has been sucking blood off UK for longer than necessary. No looking back. No deal. That‚Äôs it.
1/1	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave
1/1	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave. We might just do the same thing here in Texas.
1/-1	The EU has done a brilliant job of stuffing up and discrediting Brexit - and the population of the UK is too stupid to realise what is happening.
1/1	The EU has even ruined the charm of Malta with indiscriminate road building. Same goes for Madeira.
1/1	The EU has grown into a monster, an anti democratic monster capable of overthrowing governments against the will of the people, they have too much power, it's just wrong
1/1	The EU has just as much to loose as the UK the parasites in Brussels are determined to hang on to the English cash cow and that's all we are to them open borders must be fantastic for terrorists no border checks come and go when they like
1/1	The EU has said NO to changes, thats the problem, all the debating in the commons is a waste of time Delaying brexit , this is another ploy by the remainers to keep the UK in the EU, this extension could go on and on for YEARS, the UK leaves on March 29th 2019
0/0	The EU has taken on multinational giants like Microsoft, Samsung and Toshiba for unfair competition. The UK would not be able to do this alone.
1/1	The EU has to pay us billions in trade tariffs plus they dont get the 39 billion for that rotten deal RUN the clock down to a no deal.
1/1	The EU have been soaking Britain of their wealth for decades. Now they will have the opportunity to take back control and establish their own destiny.
1/1	The EU have done nothing but try to bully the U.K. into submission.
1/1	The EU have said no renegotiations so i don't see any alternative to leaving with no deal.
1/1	The EU idea was hashed up by the NWO Kleptocrats (bankers  & multinational corps - NOT their citizenry) for self serving benefits (some benefits did trickle down, but not enough & way too much collateral damage - especially in recent years). Glad to see Brits open their eyes for a change.  This Vox post is heavily biased and almost completely wrong (w/regards to employment & trade, especially). The only thing this article got right is that the transition will be difficult. But, the UK is better for it.
1/1	The EU is a Dictatorship. Nigel F is an asshat but he wasn't kidding when he asked who they were, because most EU citizens don't have a fucking clue about who is making these laws and regs and have zero say on which ones effect their Country. I don't want to leave the EU, I want to see it collapse!
1/1	The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
1/1	The EU is a bigger threat to European civilization than Hitler and Stalin ever were. Hopefully one day the european masses will see this, and string the lot of them up in the streets.
1/1	The EU is a conglomeration of unadulterated chaos.
1/0/0	The EU is a corporate government and leftists don't see it
1/1	The EU is a dictatorship.who would not want to have more control over there own country.
1/1	The EU is a disgraceful organisation in my opinion. It has become far too large and complex. It is not just a threat to democracy its killed democracy.
1/1	The EU is a fascist organisation. We need to hold our nerve and Theresa must go.
1/1	The EU is a monster Ponzi scheme run by dictators in Brussels! Thank God we are leaving!
0/0	The EU is a scapegoat, as are the immigrants. The UK's problems were caused by the 2008 financial crisis¬†just like most other countries problems.
0/0	The EU is a single market in which no tariffs are imposed on imports and exports between member states.
1/1	The EU is a sinking ship, a giant bureaucracy set up to feed the bureaucrats whose only job is to prescribe ever more self-serving socialist policies to grow the bureaucracy, while remaining completely impotent on real critical issues like the migrant crisis
1/1	The EU is a sinking ship. It's a dying idea and Britain should get out now.
1/1	The EU is a tyrannical and discredited sham that has hijacked and imposed political union on half a billion people. Far from the promised land of milk and honey, in reality the EU has proved to be the shoehorn for forced and unwanted "ever closer union". The EU is a racket that continues to strangle the life out of Europe with its incompetence and constant crises. The EU must be destroyed
1/1	The EU is all about a new world order, one world government. To all the native (white) people of the UK, embrace your new found sovereignty and take your country back. Starting by closing down the 3rd world Muslim immigrant flood gates and kicking out the ones that are already there. As for the affects on the economy, jobs, travel etc. you can figure out those problems as you move along. A country is suppose to be defined by its people not its borders. This is the first "small" step to halting the genocide of the white race and its culture by the "J" team.
1/1	The EU is an "irresponsible guardian of democracy", why do you think we are having this referendum? Should Remain win, then Leaver's will continue to campaign, to highlight the idiocy of belonging to such an organisation. Vote Leave.
0/0	The EU is an increasingly important pillar of our security, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression.
1/1	The EU is an undemocratic organisation. Therefore they have not accepted the result of the 2016 Referendum and still haven't accepted we are leaving. All this time they have been entertaining die hard Remainers like Tony Blair, Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis who have told them they can overturn Brexit. All the above and many others in the Cabinet are simply looking for the valued prize, a place in an institution which can keep them in wealth and luxury for the rest of their lives. Peter Mandelson and Neil Kinnock, both backing remain in the House of Lords are in the pay of the EU as long as they keep the flag flying. They are just two of many I am sure. The whole Club is rotten to the core.
1/1	The EU is an utter disaster, best wishes to the UK getting free of that sick dying animal.
1/1	The EU is basically controlled by germany. Yep the germans finally conquered europe, and anyone that doesnt like it is a bad guy
1/1	The EU is collapsing anyways.  Mind as well get out before it gets bad
1/1	The EU is collapsing before our very eyes! We are getting out just at the right time!
1/1	The EU is collapsing. If your house were collapsing where would you rather be - in or out?
1/1	The EU is collapsing. Italy is nearly bankrupt and we ain't paying the 39 billion so hard BREXIT it is. We all have computers and Amazon if things go Pete tong.
1/1	The EU is communist, not fascist.
1/1	The EU is corrupt, self-serving, and is certainly no friend of the UK
1/1	The EU is dead .. try watching YouTube or some other of the videos of the YellowVests right across France, not just Paris. Also Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium
0/0	The EU is doing exactly what it said it'd do. It's not its fault the Brexiters are clueless.
1/1	The EU is doomed.
1/1/1	The EU is dying the only answer is to disband it
1/1	The EU is every citizen's enemy and many don't realise just what the EU is or its plan.
1/1	The EU is failing politically and economically. It only works for Germany economically, but politically it is seeing the rise of extremism again because of mass youth unemployment and the hollowing out of the middle class. Thus it is a perfect time to leave before we have to bail out the corrupt Italian banks.
0/0	The EU is far too complex for Trump supporters to understand. If it can't be explained by a slogan on a hat they don't want to know about it.
1/1/1	The EU is finished anyway, so it's either get out now or wait until it all falls apart. Personally I think get out now is the better option.
0/1	The EU is going to fail
1/1	The EU is going to fail with in the next 10 years
1/1/1/1/1/1	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made.
1/1	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made.  The sooner they get on with it, the better! Socialism and open borders destroys countries, it doesn't help them.
0/1	The EU is horrible, rather be poor than a slave to the E.U
1/1	The EU is in a terminal state and any country that wants to survive needs to get out now.
1/1	The EU is in meltdown mode. Time to save ourselves and our children before we go down with them. This is our one chance to be free again.VOTE LEAVE.
0/0	The EU is in the driving seat. Brits need to stop thinking they're the powerful empire they once was. They're not. Their empire was defeated long ago. They're nothing but an insignificant island nation that needs the EU more than the EU needs them
1/1	The EU is in the process of implementing World Socialism, even Communism
1/1/1	The EU is just a gravy train for the elite....a bureaucratic monster in a feeding frenzy. How any self respecting Brit can defend it is beyond me.
1/1	The EU is like the emotionally abusive boyfriend that you can't leave but desperately want to. It treats you like c r a p, says you can't hang out with your other mates, steals all your money and intimidates you. Why on earth would you stay?
1/1	The EU is no friend of the UK. If UK doesn't break away now, it will be much worse in a few years when they don't have any other choice.
0/0	The EU is not bluffing.¬†The integrity of the Single Market is much, much more important than the losses of a no deal.
0/0	The EU is not falling apart, Young people WANT the EU, you can clearly see this in Brexit results, most Young people acually voted to remain and in some decades those Young people will be the majority. The EU can't find a common immigration policy or a tax policy for example because older people don't want them, but Young people do, but again, sooner those older people will not be there anymore, and Europe will be able to live as a country
1/1	The EU is not going anywhere. Nothing stopping us reapplying to join the EU in 40-50 years time when the impact of brexit can be properly evaluated. With real world facts... Remainers really are so shortsighted and selfish.
1/1	The EU is not what it was when we joined and we voted to leave after 50 years of loyalty. Most of the world are not EU members and they are just fine, trust me when I say us Brits can handle it too.
1/1	The EU is out dated.. Stale.. One sided and racist to its own... Time to go!!!
1/0	The EU is setting the Trap to keep you poor souls in, and may is going along with them. I hope there is an explosive demolition charge in the chunnel
1/1	The EU is strangling us. We don‚Äôt need life support from a foreign parliament or an isolated ‚Äúsingle‚Äù market when there is a world of trade to tap into. We need to remove this tumour and recuperate.
1/1	The EU is structurally flawed and doomed. It was modeled on the Soviet system - and it is heading in the same direction (down). When you are aboard a sinking ship, the only sane thing to do is abandon ship. We could do so much with the ¬£55 million a day we pay to the EU.
1/1	The EU is the fourth Reich.. Vote to leave now, sign the government petition..no 200165 Leave Now.
1/1	The EU is the new USSR
1/1	The EU is the past. 93+% of the world population live outside the EU and all the economic growth is outside the EU.
1/1	The EU is the prototype for the New World Order, in which democracy will cease to exist
0/0	The EU is well and alive. The UK is paralyzed, confused and scared.
1/1	The EU isn't doing as well as it used to and it's really down skewed economic reporting that suggests the eurozone is doing great.

1/1/1/1	The EU just trying to get every last penny out of us until we leave.
1	The EU may be good for small countries or poor countries, but for the UK, I think the benefits we get are far less than the things we pay.
1/0	The EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU. This is a wonderful day for the world.
1	The EU needs the UK more then the UK needs the EU, we must not forget that.
1/1	The EU needs to DIE! They are just not getting the message. I live for the day there is no EU, and I hope I get the see all of their leaders hung on live TV!
0/0	The EU negotiates trade agreements with the rest of the world. Outside the EU Britain would have to renegotiate trade deals alone. While the EU is the world‚Äôs largest market, a UK outside the EU would not be a high priority for other counties to negotiate a trade deal.
1/1	The EU only want our money, we have been mugged all these years.
1/1	The EU or whatever it was called under it's previous trading names has never give Britain any respect since the off in 1973. Why on earth should it start now? The raison d'etre of the EU is to be anti- Anglo-Saxon. They hate Britain and they hate America. Simple as that. And there isn't a cat in hell's chance of a UK politician who will stand up up to them.
0/-1	The EU politicians are elected by proportional representation,which is more democratic than the UK system
0/0	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again
0/0	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again.
1/1	The EU says no - the UK says no deal it is then. Finally we would get the clean break the UK needs to flourish without kowtowing to any more EU rules.
1/1	The EU seems to have had a very pro-internet censorship. So that is very worrisome. The less countries it has under it's wings the better.
1/1	The EU should be told it's a 100% hard brexit those beggars can support themselves. no more subsidies  no more military defence  no more tolerance of the parasites
1/0	The EU should go hard on UK. It was a stupid decision, made by ignorant old people. And for crying out loud, why was it accepted?  For such major decisions a 52% is not good enough
0/0	The EU should go hard on UK. It was a stupid decision, made by ignorant old people. And for crying out loud, why was it accepted?  For such major decisions a 52% is not good enough.
0/0	The EU should place now VISAS for british people to cross to Europe and punish them with trade and companies sould leave the UK too leaving thousands jobless I would love to see it so now they can start looking for jobs in other countries and immigrating hahaha Karma and then be hunted and deported to the UK
0/0	The EU should stand firm and the UK Brexiters should suffer for their stupidity!
1/1	The EU should've stayed a trade union and not become a legislative one.
1/1	The EU show themselves for the borg that they are. Assimilating countries into it's collective, replacing their currency, overruling their legal system, imposing it's political will on the population. The line must be drawn here and no further!
1/1	The EU unelected dictators have been trying to thwart the UK leaving from the begining.
1/1	The EU wants to become a fully fledged federal government with direct control over all member countries basicly turning them into states rather than countries.  I want no part of that, for this reason alone if another referendum happened I'd vote leave again.
1/1	The EU wants to end democracy in Europe. And when they do, the people of Europe will realise how vulnerable they really are.
1/1	The EU wants to make the UK suffer, they have no intent on being fair. If you have no choice but to stay, then what is the EU really. Not a democratic body, more of a gang.
1/1	The EU was a good idea when it was about trade, turned bad when they decided to be social engineers and usher in 1984.
1/1	The EU was a terrible experiment
1/1	The EU will collapse soon. Thank God we voted Brexit.
1/1	The EU will collapse soon.Thank God we voted Brexit.
1/1	The EU will collapse very soon. Unchecked immigration and member dissatisfaction will ensure that. The UK saved itself.
1/1	The EU will give much more If pressed properly, and rightfully so...if UK suffers, EU will suffer, and more. So go out there and tell them how it‚Äôs going to be.
1/1	The EU will learn that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The British hate the EU
1/1	The EU will negotiate in the event of a no deal Brexit. They will have to. Remainers are just lazy thinkers
0/0	The EU will not start new negotiations. There are two choices left and one of them will happen, a new referendum or hard Brexit. If the UK holds a new referendum, then Brexit will die for the simple reason that more people have become aware of what the consequences are. If they choose a hard Brexit, it will bring economic hardship to the people of the UK, there is a whole lot more than just items costing more at stake. Think about this for a moment, Britain is far from self sufficient, it needs to import more than half of it's food sources. If you think this is bad, you haven't even seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Automotive industry in the UK is most foreign owned and those that are actually still owned by Britain use foreign auto parts, mostly from Germany. The Ford's Britain drive come from Germany. Farm machinery, foreign, drugs are imported from the EU, everything will become much more expensive. The EU will be economically hurt, but nowhere nearly as bad as the UK will.
0/1	The EU will not survive whether or not the UK leaves. Economic migration and the collapse of Schengen will be the death nell. The Euro collapse will be the final straw. Vote OUT.
1/1	The EU will pay for their arrogance against us Brits either give us what we want or the EU suffers when we become the European off shore tax heaven.?
1/1	The EU worked well up until 2002, when it consisted of rich, reputable first world countries.
1/1	The EU's 'hard won victories' were not moral triumphs against an encroaching darkness but thirty years of deceit, manipulation, bullying, false terms. obfuscation, distortion and disguise. The EU is still seeking to create a federal Europe against the wishes of the people of Europe. Those who oppose these anti-democratic and totalitarian aims are not 'populists' but democrats. There. Fixed it for you.
1/1	The EU's agenda has always been the same. They want to rule us all.
1/1	The EU's refusal to remove the backstop should come as no surprise. We're dealing with fanatics who won't be happy until the whole of Europe is put under the yoke of a single government, and they hate the democratic decision of the British people. Let's ditch Brussels and go WTO!
0/0	The EU, or rather, Europe is an idea of unity and fraternity
1/1	The EU, should be illegal.
1/1	The EZ is on the brink of recession. Considering the current costs to businesses for relocating at least part of their operations in the UK, it seems some would like to delay Brexit. It's the 29th March 2019, legally. Get on with it, deal or no deal.
1/1	The Electoral Commission is not trusted to be impartial and a number of its leading figures have said very prejudicial things about Brexit
1/1	The Eu finance is going down quickly they will destroy us or try to
1/1	The Eu is a criminal organisation , led by gangsters, banksters and psycopaths. Every country should leave it asap.
1/1	The Eu is essentially undemocratic and run by appointees who cannot be removed individually from office
1/1	The European Superstate will destroy accountability. The UK voted for freedom.
1/1	The European Union is a massive bureaucracy where the people do not even get to choose if or when politicians get elected. Britain is the first to realize this.
1/1/1	The European Union is a scam against the people. üá¨üáßGO BREXITüá¨üáß
0/0/0/1	The European Union is one of the worst ideas of all time and it should have stayed as a trading block. It is a bureaucratic nightmare and the sooner we get rid of it the better. However, we should have remained inside it and hoped for change, which probably would have happened it the end. Instead, we have put our whole economy at risk by being way to bold. The Eu is bad but it's not that bad.
1/0	The European Union is programmed to receive. You can checkout any time you like...but you can never leave.
1/1	The European is starting to collapse, it will be them who will help from us and we'll be a better country with out them .
1/-1	The French tried that and look what they ended up with .If your British,proud to be British and want to stay British the only party to vote for is UKIP,they aint perfect but by the cringe they are damn sight better than the alternatives.
1/1	The German led EU project is the German 4th Reich in all but name.
1/0	The Germans alone have systematically devastated our auto industry, in order to strengthen their own exports to the UK
1/1	The IMF, Osborne, Carney etc are all basing their facts and figures on TODAY, not what it will be like in 2 years time when more of our businesses are enduced to mainland Europe to provide employment there, NHS costs have increased by 35%, not enough schools, power shortages, water shortages etc. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE we are only wanted for our money and assetts. VOTE LEAVE
0/0/0	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Brexit could cause a sharp drop in house prices.
1/1	The Irish border issue is basically the EU threatening terrorism. If the IRA want to kick off again, we, the British shall ask the yanks to get involved, with a huge military invasion of Ireland to start the war on terrorism !!
1/1	The Irish fishing industry was once a major employer all around our coast. And thanks to the EU our ability to maintain a viable fishing industry is uncertain. What a ridiculous prospect for an island nation. #Irexit should follow #Brexit
1/1	The Islamic immagrants are destroying the Europe. And the British people don't want that. So, Brexit is reasonable.
0/0	The Leave campaign was based on lies
0/1	The Leavers need to wake up from their Imperial daydreams
1/-1	The Left seems to have a new tactic where if they lose a Democratic vote, they immediately engage in a campaign of media saturation to demoralize and delegitimize the original choice and coax the public into sentiments of wanting the original choice to be ignored or undone.
0/0/1	The Liberal Democrats are strongly pro-EU, and have promised to stop what they call a "disastrous hard Brexit".
0/-1	The Lincoln audience is largely supportive of Gina Miller. Maybe Britain is majority #remainernow. People have changed minds perhaps, based on sensible assessment of risks of Brexit
0/0	The MAJORITY will be HAPPY with a NO DEAL.
1/1	The Malthouse compromise or ‚Äòsort of Brexit, better than no Brexit‚Äô WILL NOT DO! It‚Äôs like ordering a Jaguar but having Reliant Robin delivered instead ...then having the dealer say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs a sort of car... better than no Jag at all‚Äù ....it‚Äôs not what we ordered!
0/0	The May/Brexit Farce - a story without an ending. About as interesting as reading a large telephone directory or watching paint dry...

0/1	The ONLY continent to grow less economically than EUROPE is......ANTARCTICA!!!!!!

0/0	The Only Certainty when it comes to Brexit is, BREXIT IS A MESS!!!!
1/1	The PEOPLE voted, brainwashed, uneducated, spineless europhiles need to stop weeping and gnashing their teeth and accept the DEMOCRATIC result
1/1	The PILGRAMIGE OF FARAGE. "NOT GRACE".WE DID IT PEOPLE THIS TIME YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1/1	The People of the UK Voted Leave - JUST DELIVER !!!!
1/1	The Queen wants us all to compromise with evil...to have a pragmatic approach to the Eu communist monolith. To accept serfdom and keep our chains for the benefit of socialist elitism - to not complain as the EU sucks all the wealth out of our country and hands it to communists like China! Yeah okay your Maj - cos that all sounds lovely. CIVIL WAR
1/1	The Remainer traitors are going to look very foolish a few years down the line.
1/1	The Remainers would rather put their trust in people like Hollande, Merkel and Juncker? That is unbelievable. If our government fails on Brexit, or anything else, we can replace them at the next GE.
1/0	The Remoaners will get used to it eventually but of course anything that may go wrong and cause a bit of an upset will always be the fault of brexiteers but hey ho thats life forty years getting into the quagmire of the EU forty or fifty to extricate ourselves from its tentecles !!!
0/0	The Right thing is to Remain. The intelligent thing to do is Remain. Lets vote Remain for our youngsters sake.
0/0	The Sun obviously does not mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost because of Brexit, because that does not help their agenda. Nor does it talking of Sterling falling further, huge inflation and economic carnage and mayhem. All because of Brexit.
0/0	The Sun will probably continue screaming for Brexit even after this nonsensical economic suicide has been voted down by a considerable majority in a second referendum.
0	The Tories chose Austerity while handing tax cuts to the Wealthy. Theresa admits that money is available but withheld. Why would an MP who's constituents have been deliberately denied money by the Tories accept a bribe to keep a Tory Government in power?
1/1	The Tory & Labour party leaderships are totally under the control of the EU - so of course, they will do anything to prevent a genuine Brexit.
0	The Tory party is dead either way after this utter clown fiesta. The damage is done so I guess you'll be leaving.
0/-1	The Turkeys voted for Christmas..
0/1	The U. S usually favors free trade. Even Trump favors Free trade, if he can get it. So tough it out, Britain, it looks like you're about to enter a brand new golden age.
0/0	The U.K. may not survive as a union, it may get even worse we could be heading for serious breakdown of law and order.
0/0	The U.K. should stop this nonsense called Brexit, because most of the people of the U.K. do not want a Brexit anymore
0/0	The U.K. thinks leaving the EU is like leaving a fitness centre.
0/0	The UE does not force immigration on the UK. It it a lie.
0/0	The UK and its idiot citizens are going to plunge the world into another recession. Thanks assholes!
0/1	The UK and the EU have been integrated for four decades, so leaving the bloc was always going to be unpredictable and complicated, no matter how it happened. But these projections put the coming impact of Brexit into stark relief.
1/1	The UK bailed out its bankrupt banks remember. And with UK tax payers money. It's the UK that is the real spendaholic of the EU.
0/0	The UK can unilaterally stop Brexit. That's the best "deal" possible.
0/1	The UK cannot be expected to give up their future freedom and independence, To prop up the EU UK will thrive once the disruption settles
0/1	The UK colonist and occupied Iteland for centuries, treated them as 2nd degree civilians when they were poart of the UK? What did you expect? Gratitude? The GDP per capita is more than twice that of the UK in Ireland, thanks to the EU. They don't need the UK more than the EU. They think with there wallets and not nostalgia that's doenst fill the stomach.
0/0	The UK colonized half the world and now fear immigration...isn`t it ironic?
1/1	The UK does not "Need" low-skill migrants pretty silly of you to state that as fact when you made so much effort to be fair during the rest of the video
1/1	The UK does not need to be in the EU to be successful. The UK was successful before the EU and will be after the EU.
1/1	The UK doesn‚Äôt have a problem with Europe, just the EU, learn the difference
1/1	The UK economy could crash and I would still support No Deal.
0/1	The UK government are a shambles.
0/0	The UK government could have controlled immigration more if they really wanted to without leaving the EU
0/0	The UK has major problems with its industries which brexit will not solve.
1/1	The UK has the entire non-European world to trade with. You have zero need of the EU for trade. None.
0/0/1	The UK has voted to leave the EU - a process that has come to be known as Brexit. Here is what is likely to happen next.
1/1	The UK has voted to leave......what would happen if you voted IN A GENERAL ELECTION FOR LABOUR.....BUT THE TORIES GOT IN......VOTE TIL YOU GOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT......RESPECT THE VOTERS DECITION.....
1/1	The UK is already united. It's far better to be a sovereign middle power than have more protection as the subordinate part of a greater whole.
0/1	The UK is being HOLLOWED OUT. If you don't oppose it, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE.
0/0	The UK is floundering towards disaster without any effective opposition. Theresa May and her coterie of (un)-parliamentary allies has carte blanche to do what they want; Jeremy Corbyn will impotently heckle from the sidelines and be ignored. Unless? Well, that's the trouble. I can't think of a single 'unless'.
0/0	The UK is gonna get really poor now. Yes the North has been neglected but what happens when even London loses its source of wealth? How poor`s the North gonna become then?
1/1	The UK is in a great position to demand things as it‚Äôs such a net importer of many European goods Germany especially Does not want to loose that and if foreign goods become more expensive domestic companies can become more competitive and more money is retained within the economy enriching UK citizens more... this video is very biased
0/0	The UK is leaving the EU, then N. Ireland joins the Republic of Ireland and Scotland gets indepent joining the EU. This left England and Wales alone who are likely to collapse
1/0	The UK is much better inside the EU than outside of it. Our membership actually brings a huge amounts of benefits to our country (https://youngeuropeansnetwork.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/what-are-the-bene‚Ä¶)
0/0/0	The UK is now an international embarrassment. Ask for the Article 50 notification to be revoked and admit that #brexit was just undeliverable nonsense. Championing it as 'democracy' is just tosh. It was a desperate idea by David Cameron to get his party out of a hole.
1/1	The UK is one of the most interesting and profitable markets in the world....that is part of the problem for the UK....there are more foreign retailers and companies selling their wares than in any other EU country
0/0	The UK is rejecting and fighting democracy.
1/1	The UK is the second highest contributor of funds to the EU - apparently our exit will blow a ¬£20 billion hole in their budget!
1/1	The UK isn't the same as many European countries. It's a lot more global and international. We should be making trade deals with emerging markets, like India. However, the European Commission has a very bad relationship with India and talks are almost frozen.
0/0	The UK just has a right wing problem and it seems like that the right wing ppl will win the debate. Leaving the EU is not like being able to join back later on but leaving that union forever.
1/1	The UK just needs to sign trade deals outside the EU to make Brussels play ball. Honestly, a clean break is the best thing that can happen.
1/1	The UK left the EU due to there suicidal immigration policys
0/0	The UK must be free from fascist brexit now.
0/0	The UK needs EU the uk cant stand on its own,if it thinks it can do business with the superpowers India,china,russia,usa, then it needs to re think because superpowers wont just give you business because they know uk is two faced
1/1	The UK passport is an expression of our independence and sovereignty, a document that symbolises our citizenship of a proud, great nation. Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world.
0/0	The UK people are going to starve of hunger, because of BreXIT - WATCH this space.
0/0	The UK should have stayed in the EU
1/1	The UK should leave... Don't Trust other random people to do your choices for you.
0/0	The UK should stay in EU and build on it.
0/0/0/0	The UK should stay in the EU, regardless of what they think about it. It's just not worth it any more to leave.
1/1	The UK should stop exporting our music to the EU or charge them a tariff to listen to it. Then they can enjoy their shit Eurotrash music and all their gypsy Jazz.
1/1	The UK should use its new position post-brexit to implement a more sustainable position on fishing.
0/0	The UK wants to leave the EU so they can be free to make trade deals with the rest of the world, while simultaneously telling the rest of the world that any deal made will be reneged upon. The integrity of the UK has gone, who would want to be shackled to them?
1/1/1	The UK was poorer after world war 2 fighting the Nazi dictatorship. We'll be poorer after fighting the EU dictatorship. For democracy it's worth the sacrifice.
0/0	The UK were never part of the Euro, so a lot of the arguments around economic sovereignty were not relative to Brexit. The leave vote will not be good for working people in the UK unfortunately, at least that's the way it's looking now (2018). It's looking like the UK has scored the biggest own goal (fuck-up) in it's history.  UK needed to remain in and reform the EU. For all it's faults, (ALL mentioned on this excellent clip) the UK's position of influence and trading benefit from being members was a much better place than where it is now.
0/0	The UK will dissolve because of this stupid decision, Scotland will join EU and not get dragged down with them, NI is lost and might even re-unite with the rest of Ireland, Whales is staying with England. What a step back in progress by you patriotic idiots.
0/0	The UK will have disastrous years to come.
1/1	The UK will once again be an INDEPENDENT, DEMOCRATIC and Soveregin nation with a British Constitution & Rule of Law.
1/1	The UK's decision to leave the EU, was probably the best thing for the EU! Now they can focus on Continental Europe. and maybe even make the situation in Greece better! Besides, the UK won't last long as a nation anyway
0/0	The UK's going to get raked over the proverbial coals in treaty negotiations.  Trade between Britain and the Continent will tank horrendously, particularly if Britain will exercise its newfound abilities to make inferior quality products.  Britons will be losing the ability to travel through the European Free Movement zone as well, significantly hampering college/job/retirement options.
0/0	The UK's is going to colapse after this.
0/0	The UK...The only country to impose sanctions on itself.
0/0	The US is a country, the EU is not. There are many in the EU trying to move it more towards being a country and a lot of people in the UK don't want to be part of it.  Personally I wouldn't mind too much and voted Remain but leavers want the EU to be a free trade group, not a nation.
0/1	The Uk is losing international respectability, the prime minister signs an agreement , which took two years of negotiations and then promptly gives two fingers to the other signatories ! Talk about infantile and untrustworthy !
1/1	The Withdrawal Agreement is fair & non-negotiable.
1/1/0	The amount of people I'm talking to who just want brexit to happen, no matter if they voted remain or leave is crazy. The EU has shown their true colours.
1/1	The anti democratic EU which has been built on lies, deception and trickery from the beginning is rotten to the core with c o r r u p tion.
1/1	The anti-Brexit morons don‚Äôt care if they give up they autonomy and freedom! They just want to suckle at the teat of unelected scumbag Bureaucrats!
1/1	The architect of Brexit was the European union. A trading block that now wants to be a federalist military union led by Germany. glad we are out!
1/1	The argument for leaving is not looking as scary as I first thought.
0/0	The argument that the EU should do what the UK asks because "they also would be harmed" brought us to the point we are at. The EU is negotiating on principles, not on convenience. The economic impact of Brexit is manageable for the EU and is nothing compared to the consequences of making exceptions to foundational principles.
1/1	The arguments that the EU can do things better at scale have turned out not to be true. That is to say they are plausible on their face, but now we have 40 years of actual data and we have nothing but failure. Anyone who has looked at statistics for countries outside the EU or travelled outside the EU knows, knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the EU is not the cause of peace or prosperity. Most of the posters on /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics haven't even left education let alone done any serious travelling outside the EU.  But it's not just stagnation it's genuine failure. The euro is the chief representative of that failure, but the incapacity to reform CAP is another, the incapacity to audit budgets, the slow pace of trade deals, the over-regulation, the incapacity to secure borders, the incapacity to accept democratic calls to "halt" on integration when treaties were voted down.  These people are not only incompetent they have taken serious and drastic anti-democratic measures by passing treaties in re-written form which the French and Dutch voted against and not permitting them to vote again. That last fact alone, even for a pro-EU person, should be sending shivers down your spine. Some Communists, few but a brave few, saw through Stalinism, they saw that the utopian promises were not being delivered. It's high time some of the pro-EU people started seeing the catastrophe they have caused rather than calling for more integration like some commisar calling for yet another five year plan. You can't just lose a referendum vote and then re-write the exact same terms and pass a treaty without a vote. It's a disgrace.  Millions of lives have been ruined across southern Europe by the euro poject, anyone who looks at the statistics or actually goes there can see. It is incredibly infuriating that this is not acknowledged in the UK because most people are so detached from it.  Finally, on top of the undemocratic moves they make at the top of the project just look at how pro-EU people run /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics banning those who oppose them without providing any reason for having done so. The democratic character of the EU, from the top to the bottom, is completely rotten.
1/1	The asylum is the EU and the lunatic-in-chief is one Angela Merkel.
0/0	The backlash will come‚Ä¶ You can fool people, you just can‚Äôt fool them all forever‚Ä¶ 16.8million people weren‚Äôt fooled‚Ä¶ it appears the rest of us will pay for the while our credulous fellow citizens learn the hard way‚Ä¶
1/1	The backstop is simply a devious way of tying the UK to EU trade law. However, both the UK and Irish governments have stated that in the event of a no deal Brexit they will NOT erect a hard border. The EU are scared stiff of competitively priced goods from the UK flowing into their Single Market but IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM, IT'S THEIRS! If they want a hard border let them erect one.
0/0	The barriers should be coming down, not coming up
0/0	The beginning of the end of Brexit.
0/0	The benefits in trade and human rights are much greater
1/0/0/0/0	The best Brexit of all, is no Brexit at all.
0/0	The best alternative for all, even Leave voters: cancel the stupidity that is Brexit
0/0/0	The best deal is stopping Brexit.
0/0	The best deal is with EU.
1/1	The best thing Britan can do is leave the EU dictatorship.
0/0	The best thing is for MPs to admit that the main problems in the UK are entirely due to successive UK Governments and nothing whatsoever to do with the EU. MPs should have the courage therefore to vote to remain in the EU.
1/-1	The big question is what¬¥s going to happen to the EU. Will the future be something like the last eight years dismal performance
0/0	The biggest problem I think is nobody seems to know what a post leave EU would be like.
0	The biggest problem with Brexit is that it rides on the Conservative wagon.
0/0	The blame for even holding a Brexit referendum lies squarely at the feet of David Cameron.
0	The bottom line is, Dumbledore would vote remain and Vernon Dursley would vote leave. I know where my loyalties lie. #EUref #VoteRemain
1/1	The box I crossed in the Referendum was Leave not Deal.
0/0	The bravado of pro Brexit British is getting annoying. Just pull the bandaid and see how much you will bleed.
0/0	The brexit should have NEVER happened, people were horribly misinformed. Around 40% of people who voted "Leave" have said now that they would never have voted that way if they knew what it actually entailed. The entire vote was fraudulent
0/0	The brexiters, all beliefs and no facts.
0/0	The british exports to the EU reached 260 billion euros in 2018 and the imports from EU 350 billion euros. A no deal brexit means rising cost for tax and handling up to 10 % of value, means the prices for british consumers will rise up to 10 %. The forecast for a no deal at the chanalis very difficult, long queues could be seen. That could cause total damages to companies both sides of the chanal waiting for parts for produktion.
0/0	The british people will suffer because they are so gullible, only read the headline but not the small print that follows it for example
0/0	The case for brexit was a story of lies and fictions
1/1	The central committee of the EU , like all central committees , is growing increasingly insular and paranoid . It will happily inflict misery on the people of the EU and it's businesses just so that it can wallow in it's dogma . If the UK is so insignificant and is bound to suffer without the elite , mighty and perfect EU  pulling the strings  why don't the EU ' leadership ' just smile and wave goodbye ?
1/1	The choice is straight forward. We either leave the EU or we accept within 20yrs, becoming a part of a future UCE (United Countries of Europe). Lets get OUT before it's too late.
1/1	The city of London has been the financial centre for Europe for many years before EU was dreamed up,
1/1	The clean break of Brexit returns us to a functioning democracy again, where the people creating our laws are the same ones we hire and fire, a somewhat fundamental aspect of a fair society.
1/1	The collapse of the EU has begun. Can‚Äôt wait for an independent Britain again
0/0	The complete lack of policy for leave is glaring. Let's just leave without a plan.... trust me it will be great
0/0	The concequences of brexit are going to be terrible‚Ä¶
1/1	The corrupt EU is collapsing in slow motion
1/1	The cost of another referendum will be an astronomical ¬£140 MILLION pounds. How dare Mr Cable, a deluded politician, advocate wasting tax payers money. Also, how dare he try and disenfranchise the 2016 referendum votes of 17.46 million British people who voted to LEAVE the dysfunctional EU. Britain will be LEAVING the EU at 2300 hrs on 29th March 2019, "Freedom Day", Long Live Brexit.
1/-1	The country will have to deal with it's mid-life crisis and come to terms with it's place in the modern world.
0/0	The damage may be done, but stopping Brexit will cauterize the wound.
0/0	The damage will be done and irreversible... In those circumstances we place our hopes wherever we can...

0/0	The day the UK elects its own version of Trump seems a foregone conclusion doesn't it
1/1/1	The decision of England to leave this EU was and is correct, especially for humanitarian reasons. The EU is increasingly developing into a fishing pond for international return hunters, an Eldorado of early capitalism. In particular, since the introduction of a genetically ill currency as a means of unification, only the major capitalists have been able to accumulate unprecedented wealth, while 90% of Europe's people have plummeted to a "prosperity level" as it was before 2000. It was the time when the two emissaries of big capital owners, Draghi and Juncker, fully determined the directions of politics, while national politicians and parliaments sanctioned all, what these both presented Now the EU are deliberately denouncing the British of self-interest and blocking all attempts to unite for an orderly Brexit in order to prevent a thorough paradigm shift in favor of the people of Europe what a Blessing on the vast majority of its people in Europe would be. Not only the yellow wasps in France, but all people in Europe would have to fight on the streets and against an order that promises an unworthy existence as manipulation mass for the overwhelming majority of people. The Germans emigrate to 250,000 / a in non-European countries. But should we all leave our Europe to capital to drain its last resources?
0/0	The delusional fantasy is turning into a nightmare for brexiteers. Shame many decent people will bear the burden casued by liars. The liars will be ok and that's the tragedy of it all.

The devil being in the detail ! a counter reformation using mission-creep through a trading union to political union , into a neo-feudal imperial world order !
0/1	The economic auguries are not good at all - we risk destroying are leading industries - finance, high tech - all to prevent immigration which pays for our retirement
0/0	The economics experts warned us, the business leaders warned us, the sensible politicians warned us. The general public used it as a referendum on immigration. They said stuff you. Now, we're all going to be stuffed.
0/0	The economy is stalling, the pound is falling, inflation is rising and we haven't yet left. The UK is tearing itself apart right now because of the stupidity of the Brexit 51%
0/0	The electorate have clearly voted for the death of the UK, but nobody seems to be able to put the country out of its misery.
0/0	The elite are using immigrants as scapegoats & working class xenophobia as a way of protecting their 6 figure income. #VoteRemain
0/1	The end of brexit at last üòÇ
0/0	The end of the UK as we know it....Thanks to fake patriots
1/1	The enemy are the pro-eu Britsh politicians - and they hide across the lib lab con. We know who they are now!!! Things are going to get very rough for them.
1/-1	The enemy within .. they have now revealed themselves to all ..and it will not be forgotten.. the game is up for them regardless of how this plays out ..
0/-1	The entire country is divided. My town voted overwhelming Remain, 20 miles away it was overwhelming Leave.
1/1	The entire strategy of remoan is to make the leaving process as difficult as protracted and as tiresome as possible. Most of the remoaning is coming from the Europhile media and politicians from within the legal profession. The sort who love Germany more than Britain.
1/0	The entire trade argument is a red herring. Brexit is not about a trade deal. It‚Äôs about who makes the laws we have to live by. Trade is a smokescreen for the consolidation of unaccountable political power and the disenfranchisement of the nuisance formerly known as the voter.
0/0	The establishment won‚Äôt let Brexit happen,Mrs May will be richly rewarded at the end of all this mess,then she‚Äôll resign and sail off into the sunset, and the British people will have been well and truly shafted once again.
1/1	The eu are desperate to keep the UK paying into their failed club...
1/1/1	The eu has removed more pointless rules and regulations than any other government or organisation in the history of the world.
1/1	The eu is a cult of drunks drunken with power run run as fast as u can dont bekieve these lies cause no one has a crystal ball
1/1/1	The eu is an Undemocratic bureaucracy
0/0	The eu is probably one of the best things that happened in Europe. The only problem is it's highly inefficient due to politicians.
0/0/1/1	The eu will die without its second biggest economy and its most powerful nation
1/1	The european union nazis, just wont let england be free. They will do anything to stop brexit.
1/1	The eurozone Is slowly but surely failing, Since its introduction in 2002, the euro had consistently underperforming in comparison to the U.S. dollar and the British Pound. Bring back the ¬£Punt
0/0	The fact that people think that Brexit will be beneficial to the UK economy even at this late stage shows just plain ignorance.
1/1	The fact the EU likes the deal means it's a shit deal. Can you send us Trump to sort this mess out please?
0/0	The far right are happier when they‚Äôre loosing their shit. Fuck em I say. Hold a second referendum and let them choke on the result
0/0	The farmers voted leave can kiss good bye to farm Subsidies from the EU they'll get Jack sh*t from the Tory government post #brexit
1/1/1	The fear and anti brexit narrative is the reason why the brexit vote won. We are not stupid.
1/1	The figures don‚Äôt lie.. The EU has been a disaster for jobs and this country, it‚Äôs beyond me why the uninformed Remainers want to stay shackled to the declining EU..
0/0	The first vote was based on outright lies that only became clear once the process to leave got underway. Attitudes have changed, because people can now see what they‚Äôre getting into. Not having a second vote would be a disastrous failure of government.
0/0	The freedom to smoke is bad for public health, likewise Brexit is bad for Britain.
0/0	The funniest thing is that if you think things are going bad for GB, wait until the day after they truly left the EU. That will be funny
0/1	The fury and destruction it will unleash will be tantamount to civil war. But sadly, huge suffering like that might be the only way to knock the cretinous "two world wars and one world cup" superiority complex out of the British psyche once and for all.
1/1	The future is bright...the future is Brexit.
1/1	The globalist elite are the only people who lose with this change.
1/1	The globalist scum will do anything to ensure they succeed
0/0	The government has employed hundreds of commercial lawyers on ¬£3000 a day each, trade consultants on similar and there are not enough. Whitehall needs 30,000 extra civil servants and cannot recruit them.  34 new regulatory bodies are needed to duplicate the work that used to be done by your so called "bloated bureaucrats in Bruxelles". Also, more customs and immigration staff will be needed, while if we leave the Customs Union, the roads around the ports and airports will become lorry parks.
0/1	The government should only rule out one thing ..... and that is A NO #BREXIT. BUT the #BBC will never run such a report as it is against its biased #antibrexit editorial.
0/1	The government's ploy ``Brexit``  has shoehorned  a monumental decision over the economic and political future  into a simplistic, asinine narrative; if you want to stop immigration, vote leave. If you are worried about the economy, vote stay.Will there be another vote? No. Does there have to be a majority support in parliament for Brexit? Apparently not. Did anyone on either side have any clue about the consequences? Categorically,  no. Is that democracy? Absolutely notPeople don't realise that referendums are nothing more than a political tool the government uses to put a stamp of popular legitimacy on something they had planned to do anyway. It has absolutely nothing to do with democracy. Victor Orban used the same tactic as an instrument to strengthen himself politically.Given the 70% turnout, the result of 34% is a very low bar. Surely such a decision needs a supermajority vote of 70%?The government has played Russian roulette with UK's democracy.  Now the gun cylinder has stopped on the bullet and they've shot themselves in the foot. A modern democracy should have checks and balances in place to protect minorities and to avoid making misguided or misinformed decisions with catastrophic consequences. The idea that any decision reached through majority rule"  is "the will of the people" and therefore somehow  "democratic"  is at best, a perversion of the term democracy  and at worst, naive gullibility."
0/0	The hard line Brexiteers are a deluded dangerous gang of fanatics.
0/-1	The house of commons is a joke
1/1	The idea of Not leaving.. should be taken off the table. Or we'll live to regret it
1/1	The idea of other countries making laws that you have to follow seems a bit insane
0/0	The idea that 52 percent of people can vote for the destruction of a country and that the other 48 percent have to go with them is laughable.
0/0	The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.
1/1	The ideal of a single state is fine - helping to compete on the world trade but we've got a communist Russia instead of Utopia
0/0	The idiotism of Britt's nationalism. I wish them well, but doubt it gonna happen. So my condolences to sane part of England!
0/0	The ignorance of UK Racist Conservative Party will bring down the UK. Just because they have the stupid idea the immigrants are the problem, when in reality the immigrants kept UK a float.
1/-1	The immigration crisis in Europe was a trigger. Some EU leaders argued that aiding the refugees was a moral obligation. But EU opponents saw immigration as a national issue, as it affected the internal life of the country.
0/0	The incredible damage done to UK by Brexit is becoming irreversible.
1/0	The irony is that now if a Brit wants a good job he or she will have to go to the EU as all the good jobs in the finance sector are leaving the UK for EU
0/0	The irony of Brexit.... If we stay within in the EU we can benefit from Nissans decision to produce Xtrails in Japan thanks to their new trade deal. Brexit doesn't make sense anymore... It never did actually.
1/1	The is music to our ears. People like you aren't welcome. Be a REAL patriot and go to Blackpool or skegness instead. Spend your money there.
1	The last thing they want is a reasonable deal, because they want to block Brexit. Its devious, dishonest, nasty and twisted, but thats exactly the way the remainer politicians and media are playing it.
0/0	The latest YouGov poll suggests that more people in the UK believe Brexit is bad, rather than good for jobs
0/0	The leaders of the pro-Leave side made a lot of promises ones they could never actually hope to keep because no one expected Leave to win. So they didn't actually have a plan.
0/0	The leave party are all just a bunch of empty expectations and stupidly high patriotism. Britain is a country that needs the support from the EU, we all flourish economically when part of a larger group. Not even in the first few hours and the value of the pound has dropped, the prime minister is retiring his position and the remain voters are admitting defeat to the security of future generations for this country.
0/0	The leave voters are ALL IDIOTS!!
0/-1	The leavers always seem to me to be a bit like a high paid worker in London complaining about the price of their rail season ticket. It costs me ¬£3000 to get to work it¬øs outrageous I am going to quit, they whine. Yes, the sensible people say, and then what? Well the railway will make the tickets cheaper if I threaten to leave, I pay them loads more than they pay me they say. Um not sure that¬øs going to work comes the sensible response, do you have a plan B? Well I could get a job locally they moan. Yes but they pay NMW so you will be saving ¬£3000 on commuting but losing tens of thousands in salary. Well they bluster, my employer will have to move the office closer to me, why is everyone bullying me. At that point the sensible people roll their eyes and everyone wonders how we got into this mess.
1/1	The left is so desperate to stop Brexit they are grasping at straws now
1/1	The legal suites will now pursue remainers. Its starting. Crowd funding to hound these undemocratic unpatriotic self interested Blaiites. Targetting them at their constituencies who want to remove the. QUITE RIGHT. They have asked for it.
0/0	The lesson here is that the EU is fully prepared to do what it takes to protect it's member states in a crisis. Far from being a fatal blow that could cause it to fragment, brexit is providing precious unity and an opportunity to demonstrate the value of internationalism to it's members.
0/0	The lies of the #Brexit billionaire press are perverting and undermining our democracy. Those orchestrating these lies must be prosecuted and jailed. If new laws are required then so be it.
0/0	The main and most important reason why BREXIT happened is purely down to the ignorance of the majority of voters. Normal/average man in the street is not up on the complicated political and economic strategies, schemes, plots, benefits etc of remaining or exiting the EU....The propaganda won...but only just. They should have set a minimum win percentage gap of say 10% to ensure a definitive win margen, something significant...not just a few percent....I live in Germany and the negitivity towards the UK post Brexit is disgusting. I would in my position have voted to remain initially, from a selfish perpective, however I am glad the the few percent win counts...Brexit will cause a few more countries to exit too, the EU will change its thinking and hopefully learn from this...We will grow stronger with a return to global trading and re-establishing our links with our commonwealth.
1/1	The main reason people voted for leave was to reclaim our sovereignty
1/1	The main reason to leave is to avoid the EURSS. Europe is not a country (at least after 400AD when it was called Roman Empire), and will never be, unless will be cancelled all different cultures, languages, laws, traditions, foods, and so on. Nazis tried to do it and they failed. Communists tried to do it and they failed. Americans tried to do it with natives, and they succeded, through a genocide of locals and importation of slaves and low paid migrants.
0/0	The main reason why UK beaches aren't still covered in sewage is mainly down to EU regulations.  That's reason enough to stay in.
1/1	The mainstream media choosing to pick out stories about how Brexit is 0ly affecting us
1/1	The majority of Americans wanted change and voted Trump, the majority of British wanted change and voted Brexit a lot of other EU Countries are not happy with the EU but can't afford to leave, once Britain has left it will give others the strength to follow. the EU is doomed, the flow of migrants caused by the German chancellor has killed it, she thought she was being clever but she has only caused hate, she will go down in history as a failure
0/0	The majority of brexiters are old traditional man.They don't realize what they vote for, their kids don't want Brexit to happen and it shouldn't happen, because it will negatively affect not only United Kingdom, but Europe as well. Especially no deal Brexit, it will be disastrous! It's also unfair 90 year old man to be in parliament and to make decisions! Britain should make a second referendum and more young people should vote!
1/1	The majority of newspapers, including the popular ones (Sun, Mail, Express, Telegraph) were all harpy screeching in favour of leaving
1/1	The majority of people who voted BREXIT want our democracy back. The EU are trying to do what Nazi Germany failed to do in two World Wars, dominate Europe.
0/0	The majority of people who voted to leave are old stupid racists by the time we leave the Eu Half of them will be in their graves by the time we leave the Eu Why couldn't they have thought about the youth
1/1	The man himself said it! Don't fall into the trap of Project Fear! #VoteLeave and believe in #ProjectHope @DCBMEP
1/1	The map isn't accurate, Northern Ireland wasn't completely blue, many constituencies voted leave.
1/1	The mass immigration from Eastern Europe to the UK will switch to Ireland and maybe then Ireland will get a party who advocate for #Irexit. ALL Irish politicians are sickening eorofiles. Well done to the UK, #Brexit was the great escape.
1/1	The masses will not vote again WE WON!!!!!! They betray us they will suffer the consequences you only have to look at France right now, it won't just be chaos but their will be strikes Why should the working people continue to work paying taxes that keep them in a life of luxury???
1/1	The massive, colossal white elephant in the room and the reason many people voted to leave is that the EU is essentially a country, an undemocratic one we didn't at any point agree to be part of.
1/1	The media has gone into overdrive with the anti brexit propaganda, Joseph Goebbels would be very impressed.
1/1	The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad.
0/0	The migrant crisis in the EU. You mean those poor kids we wont let into the country to be with family ALREADY HERE. Instead of some Russian Mafia's whore collection(1000s of children by themselves have already vanished)? But even so your going to give up a united Western Front in Europe in because a few of these refuggees might be terrorists? Well congrats you just let Terrorism win.
1/1/1/1	The migrant crisis is gonna end Europe...
0/0	The moment I'm old enough to i'm leaving this shitty island. I love it when the younger generation don't get a say in things that will massively effect the future when it will affect us the most yet heres Mary with at least 5 years left in her being nostalgic with patriotism deciding the future of our country when she's not even going to be around long enough to be able to see it.
0/0	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it.
0/1	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it.  Take back control. Exit Brexit.
0/-1	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it. Take back control. Exit Brexit.
0/0	The more I hear from brexit supporters the more I realize they are generally either mad, ignorant or have looked for scapegoats their whole lives to blame for their own pathetic failings.
1/1	The more I read of "Remain" arguments, the more I come to doubt whether Remainers have any grasp whatsoever of economic theory or practice
0/0	The most extraordinary thing about #Brexit is that we don't have to do it. Every other national emergency I can think of, we had little choice but to deal with it. This one could be avoided.
0/0	The most overwhelming feeling of disgust I ever experienced was the morning after the referendum. I'd gone to bed confident remain would win and woken up to the news... After spending a couple of hours watching the news and rushing to get to work on time, I got off the bus near my office around 9am, feeling stunned. Just at that moment I saw a group of drunk middle-aged men and women decked out from head to toe in "Vote Leave" and "Take Back Control" propaganda smiling and shrieking with laughter. I don't think I've ever felt so much hatred towards complete strangers before... That day I started looking into work opportunities abroad and now I live in Germany, with a far better standard of living than I had in the UK, so I guess I'm doing pretty well. I sometimes feel kind of bad watching the Brexit car crash from outside though, not being able to do anything. Survivors guilt I guess!
0/0	The most useless PM and government ever. The only benifit from brexit is that the Tories will be out of power for decades üòé
0/0	The naivety of the BREXIT lot is staggering. Do they not realise that most of the world is ready to get their own back and that includes the Commonwealth who are loyal while the Queen is alive but just watch the change when Charles is King. We will become nothing. To be honest we are not important to the rest of the world but the EU is. Like it or not and I am a eurosceptic but the only way forward is to stay.
0/1	The new economy for British women will be selling BJs to Romanian and Bulgarian lads stag weekend tourists after the UK economy tanks and the UK becomes the cheapest booze & working girls capital of Europe.
0/0	The number of nurses from Europe registering to practice in Britain has dropped by almost 90 percent.
1/1	The only deal on the table is a No Deal.. May Out.
1/1	The only future of Europe are free, sovereign and independent countries. This artificial form, that has been named misleading as union, is totally wrong and destructive.
0/0	The only good Brexit is No Brexit.
0/1	The only long-term solution is, sadly, a hard Brexit. Only when the Leave voters see how the rich Tory right make millions from this decision and the workers in the auto-,aerospace-,pharmaceutical-fishing- and agricultural- industries see their jobs evaporate and the old & the sick see the NHS deteriorate will we see their hate for the EU redirect itself to the Tory right wingers....or maybe not....perhaps the EU will be blamed for an eternity because they wouldn‚Äôt change their 4 Freedoms in order to help us out. Time is getting short....which car manufacturer will jump ship first? My money is on Nissan...
1/1	The only lunatic idea is that there is any option other than to leave.
1/1	The only ones that can be scared about this are the young ones. It is easy to misguide and lie to them. Britain did very good on their own. Their young need to be taught this.
1/1	The only ones to blame for the entire fiasco is the whinging whining remainers that would rather serve the EU than the people they are suppose to represent.
1/1	The only option for Britain to be a free sovereign nation is to leave the EU. The alternative is to be governed by an unelected foreign dictatorship.
0/0	The only people I directly know who want brexit are ill educated relatives. I don‚Äôt know how much they know about brexit but it there seems to be a correlation between how educated someone is as to what there stance on brexit is.
1/1	The only people shooting themselves in the foot are the EU
1/1	The only people who don‚Äôt appear to understand what the EU are trying to do to us are our parliament of naive, infantile politicians who seem to take everything at face value.
1/1	The only politician i trust 100% is the messiah! The one and only Nigel Farage. Bring on the Brexit party.
1/0	The only problem with Brexit is prime minister May. Remove her and we can make a clean break from the EU, leaving us free to trade with the world with the added advantage of not being governed by a dictatorship.
0/0	The only real reason why Britian wants to leave the EU cause they can't stand having so many brown people in their country.
0/1	The only reason why Britain doesn't have any heavy industry is because Britain has dismantled it and sub contracted it to China and other parts of the world where they can produce thing at 1/10 of the price this is produced in Britain. it's Britains fault don't be so short sighted and Blame Germany's Bankers and the EU
0/0	The only single market I want to live in is Tinder.
1/1	The only thing that will bring the EU to it's senses is NO DEAL, LEAVE NOW!
1/1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!
1/1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!!
0/0	The original Brexit vote was made on the basis of incomplete or false information. Now that people have all the information, hold another referendum and see how the people vote now.
0/0	The original referendum was based on LIES and was a total blind vote, all Tory moves are corrupt we have never and never will have a say what happens in our Country under Tory dictatorship
1/0	The parliamentary conservative Party severed the link between us and them when they removed the power of constituencies to choose candidates in 1998. Instead they are picked by central office. Slowly but surly the MP's reflecting constituents views have retired and been replaced by place men. They no longer represent constituent views. They no longer reflect me, my values, views, beliefs or world view. BREXIT party COUNT ME IN!!
1/1	The part I find perplexing is how British Remainers over the last nearly-three years clearly want Britain to fail badly, all because we said no, not to Europe, but to a foreign body of bureaucracy growing stronger in its attempts to rule the continent. OK, so you're upset we're leaving. Fair enough. But the level of vitriol since day 1 of losing has been an eye-opener. It's going to take a lot of work pulling this nation back together again.
1/1	The parties in parlement conspire to stop brexit. I dont believe for one moment that no deal brexit will be to the disadvantage of business, the government is just busy with scaremongering.
1/1	The people demand freedom from the EU.
0/0	The people have been lied to - they had no intention of carrying out the result. Stop Brexit - Leavers and Remainers unite against the political class and the lies in their party manifestos and referendum nonsense. The political class have lied to and misled the people. Stop Brexit. Blame the political class.
1/1	The people have spoken and it must be respected.
1/1	The people have voted , if we do not leave it will be a massive betrayal and insult to democracy !!!!! we do not want a continual dilution of our race/ culture we need control back of our borders
0/1	The people have voted to leave, the government are trying to handle leaving in a way that doesn't totally destroy us as a country. The problem is, there isn't really a scenario which doesn't destroy us as a country, which is why no one can agree on anything, and why leaving was such a bad idea in the first place.
1/1	The people in the UK gave an answer in the Referendum, over 2 years ago. The answer is still the same.
0/0	The people of the UK didn't have all the information before the first referendum vote. Not everyone was engaged on this topic.  Clearly now, everyone knows everything that is at stake whether you are leave or remain.
1/1	The people vote and if they vote wrong then we do it again until they get it right. - Democracy
1/1	The people voted for Brexit. They have to leave the EU. If Parliament doesn‚Äôt vote to approve an exit then Britain isn‚Äôt a democracy.
1/1	The people voted for it. Why is this even a discussion?
1/1	The people voted in a majority to leave the EU. Parliament is stalling - WE WANT OUT OF THE EU - NOW!
1/1	The people voted to leave and leave we must and then it will be up to us without the eu interference and the Lisbon treaty is un acceptable.
1/1	The people voted to leave and no deal is the best way
0/0	The people were promised a Rolls Royce, instead it seems they‚Äôll be getting a 30 year old used Lada Niva ... they should be asked if they‚Äôre still okay with the Lada!
1	The people who are voting remain are the kind of people who do art and drama at university
0/0/-1	The person who came up with the idea of this roundabout, was definitely on LSD
0	The point is not that it's impossible. The point is, that it's just a rather bad idea to do so because it has negative consequences because it creates a legal vaccum.
1/1	The point is we're gone anyway, we never signed up to become a state within this EU one nation mash up, junkers only today claimed Ireland as the EUs, let the EU become one nation, let them try and crush peoples nationalities, brussles are petrified of nationalism or as they like to call it populism, let's get back to a simple trading agreement if possibly and the EU can push off with the one nation vision!!
0/0	The politicians that pushed for brexit should be put in jail for convincing the public that it would be easy with no consequences. May could never get a better deal, no one could! What bargaining power does the UK have when the EU hold all the cards?
0/0	The poor of England and Wales voted to turn on the elite by backing a campaign led by people equally elite and even more right wing.
0/0	The poor will get poorer and the rich will get richer. Smh UK. Now trade deals get more expensive making food and recourses more expensive. The people who voted Brexit really only looked at how it would benefit them.
0/0	The poorly educated...they don't realise they voted to be poorer.
0/0	The pound will drop massively if we decide to leave.
1/0	The price will be paid by many younger generations who won't enjoy the benefits we had or they'll need to have loads of money to have some of those privileges
0/0	The price will be paid by many younger generations who won't enjoy the benefits we had or they'll need to have loads of money to have some of those privileges.
0/0	The pro-brext idiots just got bored of being down voted and unsubscribed.
0/0	The problem here is that lots of Brexiteers are in full on denial. They seem to have the memory of tadpole when it comes to bad news about Brexit.
0/0	The problem here is that we miss out on a lot by leaving, and the EU lose by us leaving. It's a lose-lose, and if you have to spend 3 hours defending a deal you made after some of your MPs left, It's not a good deal!
0/0	The problem is Britain thinks they are more important than they really are.
0/0	The problem is that Brexiters largely understand very little and what they do understand is distorted rubbish. Therefore hard Brexit sounds doable. The more you dig and find out how our economy has become tailored to the EU do you realise how destructive it‚Äôll be to leave so aggressively. It‚Äôll mean millions of jobs for several years.
0/0	The problem is that everyone saw how Brexit was a bad idea... right after they voted "yes".
1/1	The problem is that the remainers never will have a better story to tell.
1/1	The problem is the EU leaders are not elected by the people and cannot be removed even by the MEP's. This is a huge problem. As the EU becomes more like a Communist - federal super state I really worry that all the things that made different parts of Europe great will all be watered down as every thing is rationed and every part of Europe becomes the same.
1/1	The problem isn't Brexit, the problem is Remain politicians trying to derail Brexit.
0/1	The problem wasn't poverty but stupidity and ignorance.
0/0	The problem we have is that the idiots who pushed for Brexit totally overlooked the fact we have a land border with the EU and an international treaty commitment not to have a hard border - duh!! Makes you wonder what else the numpties could have forgotten to think through
1/1	The problem with a 2nd ref is that it COMPLETELY undermines the intelligence of those who voted Leave, which ironically, was the issue during the entire campaign. My ballot paper simply asked me if I wanted the UK to leave the EU, yes or no. It didn‚Äôt ask me if I wanted a deal or not. It was very simple and straightforward, and to suggest that Leavers were ‚Äútricked‚Äù and ‚Äúlied to‚Äù is deeply insulting. We knew EXACTLY what we voted for.
0/0	The problem with idiot Brexiteers like this guy is that they think that this is a negotiation between equal parties. This is not a negotiation between equal parties. The EU has the ability to dictate the terms and there is nothing the UK can do. They can cut their losses and do without the UK very well. There is nothing that Britain produces that some other EU country doesn't produce.
1/1	The prodigal son may be the only sole survivor post the political and economical Titanic that is the European Union.
1/1	The question now is does the E.U. want to show goodwill & still have a very close relationship with us as a staunch ally & trading partner post-Brexit OR do they want to simply be nasty & vindictive towards for having the temerity to leave the E.U.! From what we can see, these Brussels bureaucrats clearly want to adopt the latter option in also sending a strong signal to any other member country who may also consider leaving their highly autocratic & unaudited organization anytime in the future. They clearly hate democracy & the fact we had our referendum despite pretending otherwise - so when people can see how they are behaving like playground bullies, it is simply staggering that there are still many Brits who want us to retain our E.U. membership!
1/1	The quiet people of our country rise up against an arrogant, out-of-touch political class and a contemptuous Brussels eliteBy Daily Mail Comment
1/1	The real face of the comunist EU.
1/1	The real purpose of the EU is to generate a multicultural SUPERSTATE, populated by `serfs' with no national identity or pride
1/1	The reason British people don't understand Brexit is because that's what the EU does best utter chaos and confusion.
1/-1	The reason Remainers lost was that all they offered was 'more of the same' to all those who are living on the breadline. Because the Remain camp failed to offer any sort of improved UK vision to the voters.
0/0	The reason it was not a great advance in democracy is that the Leave vote was not a vote for anything. It was against over-controlling laws, which were mostly misunderstood because of the misrepresentations of the Brexiteers. Let us find a way to improve our situation, not just pull everything down.
0/0	The referendum result was the revenge of the retards. I have always said that not all people should have the right to vote.
0/0	The referendum was a disaster for the country. The leave side was partially funded by large amounts of questionable money and manipulated by foreign interests. It was full of lies and deception and promised unattainable results. It was also a disaster as it was dreamed up to try to heal Tory divisions. All it revitalised was racism and exceptionalam and stupidity and the whole kingdom has been ruptured
0/0	The regulations that come from the EU are good for UK citizens on the whole,such as workers rights and consumer rights
1/0	The remain campaign had everything in their favour. They had big banks, the CBI, the IMF, Obama, the government, all the big corporations, the Bank of England ect ect ect and yet people still voted leave. People therefore REALLY wanted to leave.
1/1	The remainers are extremely disrespectful people!
1/1	The remainers are going to feel really silly WHEN the tyranical EU implodes and Britain doesn't go down with their ship.
1/1	The remainers are shocked that the government is taking up the advise from the people.
1/1	The remainers should just move to a EU nation
1/1	The research funding one is wrong, we give more money to the EU than we receive
0/0	The rest of the EU has learned how to work together, while UK's hasn't. And it seems UK people have a blind eye towards global economics and politics.
0/0/0	The rest of the world is now showing its 'I told you so' face
1/1	The result of the United Kingdom European Union Referendum of 2016 wont change!
0/0	The result will be disastrous for the UK. The UK government has no plan for a post Brexit and none of the right wing fanatics who in influenced the vulnerable of the UK citizens had a clue.
1/1	The result would still be "leave" and by a bigger majority, now that the public have seen the tatics used by the EU.
0/0	The result? You‚Äôll ‚Äòfeel‚Äô like you have more control and sovereignty, but it will be illusionary.
0/0	The sad part is that the people who voted "leave" will never understand the negative effects of Brexit in their small, homogenous, insular worlds.
0/0	The saddest part for me is that I don't think it is was people's hate towards the EU that ultimately tipped the scale towards Brexit, it was people's love for the NHS.
0/0/0/0	The same as what seems to me to be the view of a large majority of EU citizens. It's a dumb decision that will benefit noone in the end, and I hope the UK government will see reason and turn it around before it's too late.
1/1	The same economists who forecast disaster if we voted leave just said the UK would be the fastest growing G7 economy.
1/1	The same way the Russian sanction work. Buying from the dutch farmer via his African sub company... U think BMW and Audi stop selling cars in UK ? That's unreal. The companies will force eu to work with UK. Because you're statement works 2 ways. A tremendous amount of people would lose jobs if UK market will be closed. As for UK they go from a 500 million highly regulated market to a 7.5 billion free for all. That's a good deal
0/0	The same way you Brits (and the rest of the world) laugh at Americans about electing Trump, rest assured that the rest of the world is laughing at you and Brexit. And we have been since June of 2016.
1/1	The scaremongering hasn't worked....you'll see just like after the referendum....life will go on! The media and their buddies in the EU were pushing the scare stories of paying for visas......a clean WTO Brexit will be wonderful and save us 39 billion pounds!
0/0	The scenario of Greek default, immigration crisis and BREXIT must appear to some Brexiters a gift from heaven
0/1	The sensible path is this.
1/1	The simple fact is that upon leaving the EU we will be in an unbelievably strong position
1/0	The single biggest threat to the UK is Brexit" Blair
0/0	The single market is a beautiful thing. It's not too late to reconsider.
1/1	The single most important thing you will do this week, don't make excuses on why you couldn't vote make the time, unless you are one of the brain washed stay campaigners, to you I say stay at home and do the UK a favour. VOTE LEAVE!!!!
1/1	The small setback for the EU from a No Deal Brexit will be worth it in the long run for the EU instead of making concessions which poke holes into the EU27 borders and market.
0/0	The so-called ‚Äúunregulated low skill migration‚Äù isn‚Äôt keeping wages down, it‚Äôs the Bosses looking at their profits and offering employment at low wages that‚Äôs keeping wages low.  Stop pointing the finger of blame at those at the bottom, and instead point the finger of blame at those controlling the companies.
1/1/1	The sooner the EU ends, the better
1/1	The sooner we are out of this corrupt club the better. I hope their whole project goes down the toilet.
1/1	The sooner we leave the better! !!
1/1	The sooner we leave these drunken idiots the better for UK
1/1	The sooner we're out the better.
0/0	The state we are in regarding brexit is all down to the incompetent tory government.
0/0	The strange thing is that often Leavers are so proud of staying in UK for their holidays they don't even have passports.
0/0	The stupidiest thing Britain has ever done, after picking Giesela Stuart as one of their politicians. Hopefully the negotiations with Britain will fail, so Britain might have a valuable lesson.
1/1	The success of the future global economy will require flexibility, adaptability and control of its own destiny. Brexit gave us everything we needed.
1/1	The tears and whining of Remainers has been beautiful today. You lost, get over it losers
1/1	The things the European emails were saying is the reason why we left. They don‚Äôt get it
0/0	The thought is unbearable. Affecting me badly..Brexiters still have their eyes closed dreaming of sun lut uplands while we'll be isolated & left in some situation like a war zone
0/0	The thought of leaving the EU is keeping me up at night and giving me palpitations. I'm not sure I'm hardy enough to cope with all of this. Please can't we stay in.
0/0	The time spent on the two sides of the argument is pretty much representative of each side's argument strengh. From an economic standpoint, if you leave you will destroy your country, so there isn't much to say for Brexit.
1/1	The toxic eu is a dictatorship that we voted to leave, thank the heavens
0/0	The trade deals seem to be a problem. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is another sticky situation. The whole thing doesn't seem like it was well thought out.
1/1	The trade unions used to exist to serve the working class. Now they're in favour of cheap foreign labour and being under the kosh of a corporate/political unelected entity.
0/0	The trend will continue to move in direction of "a rethink" as one by one the ludicrous promises made to the electorate get holes blown through them. The trend willbe reinforced as the UK sinks into prolonged stagnation and the EU economy builds up momentum. It's as if the British millstone has been removed from around the EUs neck and the clouds of negativity created by Brextremists and their Eurosceptic forebears dissipates and gives way to a sunlit upland. The European project will continue and once again the UK will repent having cut its self off from its neighbours. Of course things may not turn out that bad if the UK comes to its senses and stops behaving like a bull In a china shop in its Brexit negotiations. It needs to replace it's Brextremists with shmooztremists.
1/-1	The trouble is that most of us have no clue as to how the Brussels monolith works, or who‚Äôs in charge
1/0	The trouble is, Brexit is being fudged by a bunch of bad losers, who are determined to remain in the EU, whatever they say in public.
0/0	The true stupidity of Brexit, it that it is obvious to even the meanest intelligence, that it unwinds a century of civilisation.
0/1	The truth is that protectionism doesn‚Äôt benefit anyone but the big companies that are moaning about Brexit.
0/0	The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty
1	The truth is there was never any intent on their part to honour the decision to leave. These are grade one A holes we are dealing with.
1/1	The truth is we voted to leave so lets live in a democracy and doit and  there is nothing you can say to us that we haven't heard so go on lets  make Britain great again or are all you remainers traitors to  democracy!!!!!
0	The truth of the matter is if you voted to leave you essentially want to live the rest of your life just surviving and without any ability to build an international business and produce real wealth for yourselves. That or you are over 65 and are deluded by the illusions of nationality and sovereignty.
0/1	The truth of the matter is that Europeans will never be a cohesive union. It is a shame really, but a reality that must be faced head on.
0/0	The uk created this mess, not the eu.
1/1	The uk government is the laughing stock , the uk people want out of a failed globalist rip-off project ; ]
0/0	The uk is a joke.
1/1	The uk own a third of the world on our own we could do it again
0/0	The uk will suffer a lot because of brexit
1/1	The ultimate goal of the EU is the creation of The United States of Europe. Staying in the EU means the end of the UK, as it would be relegated to nothing more than a district council.
1/1	The undemocratic nature of the EU political union is the clincher for me. Dictatorships never end well, and as a citizen of the country that founded parliamentary democracy, I resent out govt being handed over to an undemocratic foreign power. We do not need to be in a political union to trade with European countries, nor them with us.
1/-1	The unemployed UK worker who will take your place and accommodation will pay the taxes that you pay now and perhaps receive the in-work and housing benefits you receive as well.
0/0	The utter ignorance of Brexiteers is staggering. Even now.
0/0	The vast majority of young people in the U.K. (Especially those living in the cities) did not want to leave the EU whereas the vast majority of the older generation did.A bit like middle American Trump voters/middle England Brexit voters.
1/1	The volume of propaganda and the attempts to keep Britain in the EU via the back door are all factors in producing a poll result which in itself is used as a propaganda item. Check out what just happened in Italy and it reminds us why we need to leave.
0/0/0/0/0/0	The vote for Brexit is a vote against Europeans, against European culture and European values.
1/1	The vote was OUT! Goodbye EU!
1/1	The voters will never forgive you, if you don't deliver BREXIT.
0/0	The voting system is flawed, and this is a perfect example of it. Simply voting 'yes' or 'no' is complete nonsense. People are completely misinformed and unaware of the legal conditions and the consequences accompanying a simple Yes or No.
1/-1	The waitress says that business rates have gone up? That's down to your local council dear and that's been a problem for about 11 years. Absolutely nothing to do with Brexit .
1/1	The way the EU is set up is incredible. If we stay in, we will ultimately lose our sovereignty and any meaningful democracy. Yes, we'll still get to vote in elections to make it feel like we're in a democracy, but we won't have any real influence over those who really govern us in Brussels.
1/1	The weakness is clearly immigration.
0/0	The whole Brexit is absolute waste of time and money (so far ¬£40bln) to appease people (majority of them racists) that can‚Äôt be appeased anyway.
0/0	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job
0/0	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job. They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
1/1	The whole EU will soon fall. That‚Äôs what I see watching from America. The EU sucks.
0/0	The whole farcical debacle would be funny , if the whole fiasco wasn't so tragic .
0/0	The whole leave campaign has been based on lies. What absolute charlatans. Why on earth would you trust the Garagistes?
0/0	The whole of the brexit mess is all planned all along, frustrate it confuse the voters so they want back in.
0/0	The whole point in Brexit was to leave the Eu, now not only are we not leaving the Eu but we're losing right to have a say in the Eu. No matter how you look at this it's bad for Remainers and Leavers.
1/1	The whole rotten corrupt system will soon collapse thank god we are out June 23rd our Independence Day
0/-1	The whole thing is a f***-up, from start to f***. We have no negotiating position. The EU has a negotiating position, it‚Äôs this: ‚ÄúWell, f*** off then!
0/1	The whole thing is the fault of Brexiteers
1/1	The widespread British view of the backstop shows a deep distrust of EU institutions and their role in protecting the interests of member states and maintaining a level playing field.
0/0	The withdrawal agreement is dead in the water and cannot be reopened. An extension of Article 50 is likely to be thwarted by the likes of Poland, potentially, and Spain if they don‚Äôt get their way over Gibraltar. Crashing out on March 29th would be obviously catastrophic economically. Worth noting that a large number of major businesses set up in the UK because it was in the EU. Many would clearly move out if the UK crashes out resulting in huge job losses.
0/0	The words of a leaver shocked me thoroughly this morning! Blaming the consequences of their own vote on the EU! Leavers, wake up and realise that this is the reality of what you voted for. If we leave the EU we are no longer in a position to benefit from what they have to offer if we do not contribute. You can not have it both ways!
0/1	The world IS still VERY divided. Which is why Brexit, and the whole idea of 'focusing inward' and trying to alienate things is just going to make it worse. Which is pretty much what the main people who voted Brexit (That i know/speak to personally) wanted, tehy wanted us more closed off and removing 'foreign' things from 'our culture' rather than embracing more and joining others.
1/1	The world is fed up with this extremely boring Brexit saga. Get it done and move on, please.
0/0/0/0/0	The world is safer with the European Union. Assuming the EU stays together, I give it 20 years until Britain wants back in.
1/1	The world outside Europe - The Real World would love to see you throw off the shackles of a moribund misplaced European experiment. You have so much to gain by taking back the helm of your own ship of destiny. Cast off the stiltifying straight-jacket of Brussel's control. Then you can get your house in order, contol your borders, decide who you want to live amongst you and start trading with The Commonwealth progressively again and put the GREAT back into Britain again. Other, commonsense nations will follow you, like Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway you could even reform EFTA again. Go on, You know you Want To.
0/0	The world will roll over puny UK. You think the trade giants like the US and China will make better deals with you than the biggest trade block in the world : the European Union? Numbers count!
0/0	The worst aspect of #brexit is not economic, it is the empowerment of the dregs of society and the 'normalisation' of their rancid identity politics.
0/0	The worst part is how incompetent and misinformed/deluded our own government is dealing with Brexit. They are clueless and are just riding on a wave of optimism and patriotism. It will and is crashing and burning and we are only a month into the Brexit process.
1/1	The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù have already had their say and they chose to leave!
1/1	Their not called refuges their called economic migrants. The people who are coming to places like Germany are going for the fact that they can just sit on befits and make kids. The real refuges go to the nearest country to them NOT to the uk.
0/0	Theiridea of courtesy is constant threats. Out of EU Titanic.
0/0	Then we should have it so, should we not? After all the Only thing Brexit will do is ... Make the Rich-Richer and the Poor-Poorer. All of Our Human Rights will be a Distant Memory as will Our Precious NHS and Our Infrastructure too.
0/0	There are 48% of us who voted against this shit
1/1	There are 6.5 BILLION other people to do business with other than the E.U...
0/0	There are SO many problems ministers should be getting on with right now - the climate emergency, our housing crisis and fixing Universal Credit, to name but a few. But trying to deliver May‚Äôs dangerous, blindfold #Brexit has brought the work of government to a standstill.
0/0	There are aren't any Muslim EU countries
0/0	There are brexiters complaining about¬† people coming from Kenya to our country on stolen EU passports is somehow the EU's fault!! Come on brexiters, get some sense of reality!
0/0	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications
0/0/0/0	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications.
1/1	There are more risks staying in the EU (more bailouts, more immigration of UNSKILLED workers etc.)
1/1	There are too many restrictions in EU law. The huge EU regulatory system limits the free trade agreements between the UK and other countries such as China, India and the United States, as well as the UK industry. After leaving the EU, the UK can avoid these regulations and better prepare for long-term economic benefits.
0/0	There are undiscovered Amazonian tribes who have done more to prepare for Brexit than we have.
0/0	There are zero upsides to Brexit. No dividend. Only massive downsides, economic damage and other losses, alongside years of turmoil as we work to renegotiate 45 years' worth of trade agreements. It staggers me that people can be so ignorant and naive. I see there's now a propaganda campaign underway on social media, spreading egregious lies about the future of the EU, in preparation for a 2nd ref
0/0	There can be no orderly exit because Brexit is fundamentally nuts. You can't apply ordered thinking to something which is actually insane
1/1	There has been a total concerted effort by all areas of the media to savage the Brexiteers views. We have faced biased accounts and I am disheartened by some politicians who have no confidence in the British people to go it alone. Why do some people still need to take rules and orders from the EU? British politicians need to begin to think for themselves and not rely on unelected bureaucrats.
0/1	There have been mistakes, decisions that were wrong, and yes, they are the establishment and the system requires dramatic change. Which is what should be our goal
1/1	There is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country.
1/1	There is going to be a lot of trouble unless the Brexit we voted for is delivered. It was a BINARY choice, stay or leave. Not leave in name only. This will be the end of the Tories if the vinegar titted one is not careful and the LAST thing we want is comrade Steptoe running the show.
0/1	There is huge danger in having non-elected administrators in Brussels dictate all aspects of peoples lives
0/0	There is no Armageddon after Brexit. Just more poverty and secession movement.s Another proof that humans are irrational.
0/0	There is no country on the planet that has less right to complain about immigration then England. They literally invaded every continent on the planet
1/1	There is no democracy in the EU. They openly admit it. And still people want to remain.
1/0	There is no doubt that a Brexit will cause economic and political pain, any suggestion to the contrary is foolhardy
1/1	There is no f**king EU money!!! It's taken from us each year and then half is returned to us with conditions attached to how it is spent. Oh, and we have to be grateful to them!
1/1	There is no law that says we must pay 39 billion. We don't need Europe and it's time to leave
1/1	There is no price that is compared to freedom and independence. So Leave is better
1/1	There is no reason why we cannot become Western version of Hong Kong or Singapore (I wonder where they learned their commercial expertise from?).
1/1	There is no such thing as a ‚ÄúNo Deal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a Brexit Deal. It‚Äôs a democratic deal. It‚Äôs an independence deal. The No Deal is a EU con trick a Theresa May created scaremongering.
1/1	There is not going to be another referendum. It is simply out of the question. We are leaving the EU and there is nothing anybody can do about it.
0/0	There is nothing wrong - for the UK- in being in the EU ! It does us great economic good and little harm.
0/0	There is one simple reason Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK. And that is the fact that the EU has to punish the UK. If the UK does well out of Brexit, other members are going to think leaving is a good idea. Poland, France, Italy... Support for leaving the EU will rise. But if Brexit is disaster and the UK gets screwed, other countries will think twice about leaving. The UK is already going, so there's no reason for the EU to make the deal favorable to the UK. Its in the EU's interest to screw the UK. So they will.
1/1	There is only one poll worth considering, the Referendum we had in 2016.
0/0	There is only one sure fire-way to solve the crisis - that is to REMAIN!¬†This whole Brexit thing is completely and utterly ridiculous!
0/1	There is only one thing taking off the table. BREXIT
1/1	There is only one way to get the change we need - and that is to vote to go!
0/0	There is simply no reason to assume the that final phase of Brexit preparation will be governed by reason, measured calculation and an outbreak of common sense - none at all. The Brexit debacle was based on lies, tory in-fighting and deluded beliefs about Britains position in the world. The only thing May seems capable of is incompetence not that this disturbs the political outlook of those who believe in unicorns or greater banana freedoms.
1/-1	There is the EU and then there is the European project. The European project of integration continues regardless of the fate of the EU
0/0	There isn‚Äôt much that‚Äôs funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha.
1/0	There it is. All the people who think Europe owes us anything need to watch this and then choke on their own narcissism.
0/0	There may be some benefits, but personally and individually, we will be worse off
0/0	There might be a few problems missing from the article but those listed should be enough to make any sensible person consider wanting to and how to put a stop to this nonsense before things get really messy.
1	There needs no debate , we had a referendum , we voted out , we cant get a decent deal so we must leave on WTO rules . Nothing further needs to be debated . Any other outcome is not honoring the democratic vote .
0/0	There never should have been a referendum (Cameron only called it to squeak back into power
1	There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream.
1/1	There seems to be little doubt that the overall British economy will be stronger after BREXIT, although there will naturally be momentary disruption.
1/1	There should be no remoaners in government, they all need to be removed from office!
1/1	There shouldn't be foreign people in the UK
1/1	There used to be a big benefit in agreeing on a telecoms or utility directive in the EU, but nowadays there is not much to be gained. So being in, doesn't have that big benefits.
1/0	There was a democratic vote - just as there was when we went in. I voted no to joining - I lost - I accepted it. I voted yes to leaving - now the remainers need to accept that!
1/1	There was a result. And the result should be accepted.
1/1	There wasn't the option of voting for a deal, it was simply stay in or leave the EU, those were the only 2 choices we were given, it's not rocket science so why all the fuss about some deal ?, Let's just leave and wing it.
0/0	There will be a tremendous brain drain. The Brexiters will get the reversal of net migration they wish for.
1/1	There will be far more problems if we DON'T leave the EU.
0/0	There will be many more reasons not to vote Tory if a "no deal" is allowed. Supermarkets, the nuclear industry, hospitals and Pharmaceuticals, the vehicle and manufacturing  Industries and shipping are all in panic mode. Even Finance, arguably the one area modern Britain leads the world, is opening up scores of facilities in 3 European capitals and Frankfurt.
1/1	There will be no benefits in the short term, but in the long term, the UK will come out smelling like a rose.
0/0	There will be no economic success.
1/1	There will be no recession if we leave the EU. We will be in charge of our own economy.
1/1	There will be other countries, like America,that will make good deals with Great Britain after Brexit.
1/1	There will likely be some pain involved, but in the end the British people will now have a much bigger say in what happens in their own country.
1/1	There's a healthy spin on this one Vox. All of the negatives about leaving the EU but none of the positives besides less immigrants? A lot of media is only presenting one side of the story here.
1/0	There's a little rat bag roaner that keeps leaving these 'BOLLOX TO BREXIT' stcikers around, more so on a life boey. I always rip them down but Monday night, thought I'd 'edit it'. Come back last night, another sticker so i 'edited' that too Seems that I'm not the only on, I saw another too that have been ripped up in the same way.
1/1	There's no confusion we voted out and all these remainers come back with is project fear over and over again, lets leave on WTO rules and prove them wrong. WTO OVER AND OUT.
1/1	There's nothing wrong or racist with wanting our British sovereignty. I'm half black and voted leave.
1/1	There's nothing wrong with Brexit, it is great for the UK.
1/1	There's only one kind of brexit, the one that won the referendum, so get it done.leave means leave.
0/1	There's too much to lose for those drunk on low interest rates, addicted to cheap labour, and infantilised by meddlesome government (pro-actively supporting bubbles, the buy-to-let market, and business, through myriad benefits)
1/1	There, now stop scaremongering and raise a glass to Brexit!
0/0	There. Is. No. #Brexit. Opportunity‚Ä¶it is a mythic and made up as unicorns, magic beans , Hogwarts, Middle Earth or Liam Fox‚Äôs trade deals. And saying it in a Spectator Leader doesn‚Äôt make it any less fantastical.
0/0	There. Is. No. Brexit.
1/1	Therefore, I support Brexit. Europe is becoming weaker and weaker every next day. Under german dictatorship, Europe will end up in bin
0/1/1	Theresa May is Britain's Obama, a failure and a disgrace.
1/1	Theresa May is actually damaging the country. Typical Remainer.
1/1	Theresa May is arrogant.  The people has spoken and they want Brexit and not a deal.  She wants the deal because she still wants to be with the European Union
0/0	Theresa May seems to be on a suicide mission & she‚Äôs taking us with her... ü§¶üèº
1/0	Theresa May‚Äôs attempt to rescue the Withdrawal Agreement will almost certainly fail. As March 29th draws near both she and Brussels will need to accept a series of smaller agreements to ensure a smooth departure from the EU
0/-1	Theresa Treasonous Incompetent Liar Kick The Can May and her cabinet of clowns, what a joke they all are. Any one who votes for Mays treasonous deal is out of their minds and a traitor to their own country.
1/1	Theresa may was a useless home secretary and it continues
0/0	There‚Äôs a connection between the Trump treason and the Brexit - I‚Äôll call that treason too. It‚Äôs Wikileaks and Russia‚Äôs use of Wikileaks to warp public opinion. I‚Äôve seen photos of Nigel Farage at the front door of that same embassy.
0/0	There‚Äôs several facts. Leave lied, consistently. Leave is trying to shift blame. Leave can‚Äôt take responsibility. The EU didn‚Äôt vote for brexit. And if you want to talk about communication, please refer to the Express and get back to me.
1/1	These EU bullies just trying to make life hard for the British, when will we just tell them to do one, hang on a minute....
1/1	These EU leaders are just a bunch of bullies . Scared that others will follow the UK example and leave. They may be saying non, non, non. but their tune may change if we withhold the billions they want? What can they do - take us to a court that we are saying will no longer have jurisdiction over us? Stick with it Mrs May. There will be something that they have forgotten about that they need which may break their stance.
0/0	These are the kind of people who voted for Brexit. They do not represent 'the will of the British people' they represent the will of fascism and racial hatred.
0/0	These are the sunny uplands brexiteers dream of. Why not enjoy them as part of the EU?
1/1	These interviews are clearly to mess up the Brexit! It‚Äôs all lies!!!
0/0	These old Brexiters don't have an economic clue and not that bothered either as they're all on pension. To them it's all about migrants. Unfortunately on day 1 of Brexit our French chums boot our customs men out from Calais allowing all the Sangate flotsam to come across the channel. Being soft in the head, we'll allow them to stay while we 'process' them.That means they're here forever - Dover becomes the new Sangate, little England putters on and slips down the economic rankings until departing the Top 10 economies a decade later. Brexiters all dead by that stage so they don't give a damn about the mess they've made.
1/0	These people are idiots, just get out already.
1/0	These remainers have no respect for the people. Leave means leave.
1/1	These ridiculous indy polls are just lapped up here,but as a proud brexiter and trump supporter,Ive gloated on here forever it seems,it will be magnificent when he is a two term president.Donald will probably offer Tommy political asylum where he will be free of persecution.
1/1	These self elected Rats in the EU Will not listen to anyone .Why should they ?They are the Dictators of EU .No one is allowed to tell the EU Rats in Parliament what to do .So dont pay a penny walk away now .No more idle chit chat
1/1	They are better off if they exit
1/1	They are going for a second referendum to keep us captured in the spider's web for good!
1/1	They are insisting on the backstop to prevent us leaving.
1/1	They are just holding us to ransom,...and we are giving in to them because there is no one with the guts of Nigel Farage to tell them to shove their deal up where the sun don't shine,.....just leave and save the 39 BILLION pounds that we will have to pay, if we stay,....they are broke, and in a bad way, they will really miss this payment.... plus...we buy much more from them than they do from us.....don't listen to the doom spreaders ....they have been wrong so far so just leave.
1/1	They are not immigrants they are migrants. Immigrants leave a society and join a different one adopting the new society as their own and obey it's laws. Migrants invade and attempt to replace a society. If British people believe their identity is worth preserving they should want sovereignty and vote leave. If you're fine with converting to Islam then vote stay.
1/1	They are out to make an example of the UK as a warning to any other countries who may also harbour a desire to leave
1/1	They are petrified that more countries will leave once they see the U.K. doing well.
0/0/0	They are truly fucked. The break up of the union is on its way and all because of the English voters, hoping to return to the old empire.
0/0	They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
0/0	They couldn't get any support for BREXIT until they framed it as an immigration issue (sound familiar?) The Southern Strategy: "Convince the majority that someone is getting something that they feel entitled to and you can pick their pockets. Convince the majority that the person receiving a benefit is a person of color and they will empty their pockets for you".Russia has capitalized on the majority's fear and disdain of people of color all over the world.
0/0	They deserve nothing more than what they voted for. They should all lose their jobs that were created only because of EU
1/1	They did NOT vote for a DEAL, they voted to LEAVE.
0/1	They didn't seem confused. They wanted to LEAVE!
1/1/1	They didn't tell you Brexit would be dropped into hibernation for years did they? Been like trying to squeeze  a Brexit peg into a Remainers square hole since.
0/0	They have spent 40 years blaming the EU for everything from unaffordable housing (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country) to overcrowded roads (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country). That isn‚Äôt going to stop. In fact, if anything, TBF, it will be funny to hear them go on (and on, and on...) blaming the EU for their own mess as the country continues to go down the pan.
1/1	They have taken a demand to give up our 10% say in the EU and retrieve our 100% sovereignty over the UK, and managed to turn it into a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô which gives up both.
0/0	They have voted for people to be worse off, they have voted for people to lose their jobs, to lose their homes, to struggle to pay their bills, to make raising their children harder
1/-1	They left cos EU is banning memes
0/0	They lied to the people when they said Brexit is easy. Since the result was very close ‚Äì 51.9 vs. 48.1% - I‚Äôm almost certain that enough people would vote differently today to stop this madness, now knowing some of the negative consequences
1/1	They must back down and they will. They always do. We should have played hardball from the start. Once they know Hard Brexit is on the table, they will dance to a different tune.
1/1	They need us more than we need them, spineless negotiation, just walk away and watch Italy and Greece take back their sovereignty too...
0/0	They only care about the leavers, why? Remainers should have a voice too.
0/0	They seem to think of this as vindication of their position when in reality it is an irrelevant surrogate for the Brexit benefits that don‚Äôt exist.  If I ever see a tangible positive for Brexit, I‚Äôll acknowledge it.
1/-1	They should all be deported,we cannot afford them.
1/1	They should have thought of all this before they joined the shitty Eu
1/1/0	They talk like there won‚Äôt be any immigration after brexit. We can let in as many people as we need after brexit.
1/1	They used Britain for tax reasons now these big companies want out before inland revenue start asking questions.
0/0	They voted Leave so they must want economic destruction and poverty.
1/1	They voted the right way. We do NOT want to be part of this totally corrupt, EU Nazi dictatorship. Only Big Business wants to make it easy on themselves, and they are willing to kill off British democracy to get their way. We must fight these Vile EU Nazi lovers in our country.
1/1	They voted to LEAVE the EU, so LEAVE. Its that simple.
0/0	They voted to leave! Lmfaoooo
0/0	They want the benefits from the European Union, but they don't want to invest in the European Union.
1/0	They were right to leave the EU however. What was once a good idea has morphed into a wasteful bureaucratic cesspool with faceless bureaucrats that interferes far too much in peoples lives and national sovereignty. they hate the idea of national votes and have crippled the poorest in society. Now in the weeks ahead will come the avalanche of other countries looking to leave this failing political union. Anti EU sentiment is greater in France than in the UK, There are calls for an immediate referendum in Denmark anti EU sentiment is on the rise all over Europe and this is the beginning of the end for the EU s we know it now.Greece will need yet another bailout next month, portugal and Spain are not far behind and the eurozone‚Äôs third biggest economy Italy is under serious pressure. All of these problems existed before BREXIT. Now watch how the central bankers will try to pin all these issues on britain leaving the EU. These issues existed long before any referendum and are largely down tho the euro/Ecb.
0/0	They will be happy until they have no jobs and no income. If they are pensioners and when the banks relocate to Frankfurt and then close, they won't get their pensions.
0/0	They will never, ever take responsilbity for brexit being a failure. It'll be remainer saboteurs who didn't get behind Britain, or drunken Junker and the EUSSR refusing us a deal, or any other scapegoat. They will never accept that they are wrong. It's always going to be someone else's fault.
1/1	They won't have to take in so many migrants once they leave. This is good for them.
0	They won't take responsibility. Guess who they will blame....... the B foreigners. It will NEVER BE their fault.
0/-1	They're not wrong. Been saying it since she embraced Brexit so eagerly.
1	They're still trying to kill Brexit and gave the country to the EU in an even worse arrangement than the one we voted to leve. It's just disgraceful, actual treason right under our noses
1/-1	They've  had over 40 years to 'sort shit out' why now are they making promises now if we stay in #BBCDebate #LittleTooLate #VoteLeave
1/1	They've had two years to prepare for a no deal ffs and they haven't done nothing !!!! What is the matter are they unable to do it or is it because they have no intention in leaving the EU !!!!
1/1	They‚Äôre trying to hold our country hostage! I say we call their bluff! #NoDeal time to walk away and protect our sovereignty!
1/1	Think big and leave the EU
0/0	Think we should vote again on brexit most people did not know what thay was voting
0/0	This ! EU just got massively cheaper cars. Post-Brexit our cars selling into EU will be tariff-laden while Japanese ones will not !
1/1	This #referendum is the patriots of the working class v big businesses and treasonous unhinged traitors! Which one are you? #VoteLeave
0/0	This Brexit WANT TRUMP and his crime FRIENDS
0/0	This Brexit shitshow is going to cause so much pain.
0/-1	This ain‚Äôt over. Get Teresa May the hell out and reload. Nigel will blow the lid off.
1/1	This and Trump in the same year. 2016 was a truly awesome year!
0/0	This angers me because they didn't think about Ireland and the fact that a huge European border is in the middle of Ireland and this will probably cause conflict but they aren't even mentioning it
1/1	This article sums up exactly how I feel. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR MINDS! Stand firm and let's just get out if they wont give us a fair deal. Have courage and be brave. Believe in this great country.
1/1	This can go on forever. The eu bullies will not change their minds, they desperately don‚Äôt want us to leave and are doing all they can to prevent it. Just let us get out of this failing corrupt eu
1/1	This confirms that the EU has a death wish. Let's hope the end comes soon.
1/1	This country is heading for great times, as soon as we cut off the leaches of Europe. Stop fearing my friend, look deeper about the EU, check out the killing rules of the Lisbon Treaty, we can‚Äôt even call ourselves a nation in 2020, that‚Äôs just the tip, it‚Äôs real - it‚Äôs true!
1/0	This deal is staged and will fail. Its all part of the grand plan to keep us in the EU. Just before the vote on this deal the EU says the UK can revoke article 50. Wow what a suprise. We wil not be leaving the EU that was the plan all along. Our vote is worth nothing.
0/0	This decision is a death blow to the poorest in the UK, unemployment will skyrocket now.
1/1	This guy who is out each day protesting for another vote to remain is renting a house a opposite Mogg at ¬£6,000 a month...who is paying the rent.????
0/1	This has a horrific beauty to it. What has happened. Good god, what have we done.
0/0	This has been the biggest waste of time and money ever, the vote should never have taken place in the first place because it was based on a damaging lack of all the facts, we were all lied to.....everyone knows that a lot of leave voters are racist bigots who don't like johnnny foreigner coming over here and thats what we fought two world wars for blah blah blah, utter bullshit....then we have the argument that we don't want to get ruled by unelected people....so just like we get ruled by the banks and directors in charge who were not elected by the public, like your boss at work who was not elected by the public, like all of the police who were not elected by the people blah blah blah......we have an over inflated opinion of the UK and think we are so much better and powerful than we actually are and can easily stand on our own feet, really?? So where do we get most of our gas and electricity from?? where does over 80% of our supermarket food come from?? we produce hardly anything anymore except thousands of call centres and coffee shops.........
0/0	This has got to stop. #Stopbrexit. #PeoplesVote #OptionToRemain. I have never felt more ashamed of being British.
0/0	This has to be one of the dumbest decisions ever made.. How will the UK economy ever work without eu?
0/0	This is  the moment for us to change - to fight for continued membership and then playing a more ACTIVE ROLE in shaping the future of the EU.
0/0	This is Gibraltar who's people voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and are now forced to live under the yoke of the xenophobic little englander mobs rule.
0/0	This is The Telegraph making stuff up. It's terrified it's readers are waking up to the fact that Brexit isn't working. It can't work !
1/1	This is a choice of common sense, that it is not the intentions of Britain to be apart of an undemocratic Union.
1/1	This is a club that we are told it is wonderful to belong too. I don't think so.
0/0	This is a crazy joke! Fed up of Brexit what a mess!!! UK is a worldwide laughing emoji
0/0	This is a good man, he knows what he's talking about. Take his advise, vote IN!
1/1	This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.
1/1	This is a perfect illustration of why BREXIT is so correct and necessary to begin with. Centralized, dictatorial, authoritarian, unaccountable, un-elected government from the outside.
0/0	This is a terrible day.
1/1	This is a video made as part of the remain campaign..
0/0	This is about immediacy, isn't it. People see immigrants in their town, but they only indirectly see the benefits. And the politicians and newspapers attribute blame - or credit - for their contribution.
1/1	This is all done to force a second referendum.It's a massive deception. This is nothing new all political parties lie and cheat. No way will I be changing my OUT vote.
0/0	This is almost criminal levels of incompetence. There is no mandate for this. What the fuck are we doing to ourselves?
1/1	This is an excellent summary and proves the Brexiteers correct. The EU are being unreasonable and arrogant. They are being stubborn and putting their politics ahead of reason and the nation's they purport to serve. If they want to play chicken then they will lose. We will drift towards no deal and they will be to blame.
0/0	This is home, our home and Earth. We will stay!
1/1	This is just garbage, nothing in here makes me change my mind. The cold hard facts on the EUnion are there in black and white in the Constitution. Its antithetical to democratic principles. I still want nothing to do with them.
0/0	This is just like when GERI HALLIWELL overestimated her valiability as a soloartist and left the Spice Girls
0/1	This is just the money that would go to british farmers anyways.
0/1	This is just what the EU wants. Every one fighting. Don't let it happen. A solution can and will be found as in other countries. There is no way Ireland is going to leave the EU as, in all fairness, the money they receive from the EU is handsome so whyshould they leave. They are far better off now than they have ever been and fair play. To start swearing and name calling is just what Brussels want. Don't give it to them. We have all got along great for many years now and will continue to do so with the will of all of us.
0/0	This is like when Geri Halliwell overestimated her viability as a solo artist and left the spice girls.
0/1	This is nonsense, they are make something out of nothing. Just because their New World Order is falling apart, they are trying to cause panic.
1/0	This is not what we voted for! Back-stabbing, secret treachery. The Government should resign.
0/1	This is now becoming an embarrassment, or rather SHE is becoming an embarrassment. The whole lot of them not just Mrs Maybot, should resign. She is so arrogant that she is prepared to plunge this country into darkness and for what ??
0/0	This is one of the things I find frustrating about the arguments for #Brexit. The #EU is so much more than just trade. It's social & cultural cooperation for peace & prosperity. I used to work on EU funded research. We're throwing it all away for no benefit. Brexit is pointless.
0/-1	This is playing games by the British politicians, also explores the disadvantage of Democracy
0/0	This is probably an insensitive thing to say but sadly its true ... most of the ppl that voted "Leave" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision...instead of caring for their young older Brits chose to hate immigrants so much they screwed their younger generation out of mobility and jobs and and an open market .... Bravo!
0/-1	This is seriously biased.
0/0	This is such a joke, Brexiteers scream about sovereignty and being ruled from Brussels. Yet they are quite willing to take us out of a Brussels based supranational organisation where we are one of the most powerful voices and benefit enormously, only to immediately subjugate us to the power & control of a Geneva based supranational organisation where we barely have a voice at all and will be forced to obey rules, regulations & conditions that make it much harder for our companies who will also face new tariffs & trade barriers.
1/1	This is the Best thing that they ever did.. Britain has been dragged through the mud with all the integration of uneducated migrants and the Muslim invasion.
1/1	This is the EU begging for a NO DEAL.
1/0	This is the SINGLE most articulated view on watering down the Brexiteers I have had the pleasure to watch.
0/1	This is the biggest one sided hit piece I've ever seen, I expect better.     The EU is an undemocratic bureaucracy.     They wanted an EU army, and to make Britain start using the Euro.     Countries shouldn't be completely united as it enforce the opinions of the majority of a continent on a  huge minority which could all reside in certain countries.  Overall, you guys are being dishonest to not tell people tye whole story!
0/1	This is the day when The UK has started the process of being ruled by Europe rather than deciding together with the rest of Europe
1/1	This is the effect of " * illegal Muslim immigration * " in the region without thinking on order of  brainlessAngela Merkel . Believe or not BRITAIN done its job..And I must appreciate decision of people of Britain.
1/1	This is the end of Political Correctness in the UK. We want a second referendum to really shove it the face of Remoaners!
0/0	This is the end. I'm moving.
1/-1	This is the kind of self-destructive rejection of reality that will lead to Europe's destruction at the hands of foreign invaders.
0/0	This is the level of how smart some of the leave voters are.
1/1	This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule.
1/1	This is the will of the people, a great victory for direct democracy!
1/1	This is the work of globalists. We must name them so that we can fight them.
0/0	This is the worst trade negotiation since Star Wars: the phantom menace
1/1	This is unbelievable. Controlling shareholders in public companies?  What ARE they on?  Suppose we then said that we want all our leccy companies to be owned by Britaish shareholders?  And forced them to be so acquired? At rock bottom cost?  This is so silly it must mark the end of the EU as a serious organisation
0/0	This is utter madness! Why don't they stop it? Not ONE good thing is going to come out of Brexit! And please don't .mention 'sovereignty', we always had it!
1/1	This is what I said to my friend just after the vote. UK voted to exit the EU but we'll soon see that this vote does not count and UK will stay in EU anyway. It is the end of democracy so the beginning dictatorship.
1/1	This is what I've been saying for weeks that the eu are taking the piss out of United Kingdom so why doesn't the queen get involved
0/-1	This is what Uncertainty does for decision making. A shame and tip of ice berg I think.
0/0	This is what happens when you act without planning You will regret and back-paddle
0/0	This is what nationalist populism does to a country.
1/1	This is what people need to know. Out means out 221747 it‚Äôs a Petition for out!
1/1	This is what the eu does... f... all...
1/1	This is why I hated the remain campaign. They made liberal idiots hijack the idea EU and Europe are the same thing. The EU is a toxic cloud, every major European country has movements to leave. It is zero to do with being anti European.
0/0	This is why I say exit brexit, get a real plan and I truly believe that the swing vote will go your way!
0/-1	This is why education is important!
0/0	This is why we shouldn't let old people vote
0/0	This isn't a fight. It's just self-harm. What do we get if we "win"? I just don't see the benefit to all this.
0	This isn't even close to a revolution! A revolution isn't lead by right wing elitists such as farage and boris
1/1	This isn't what I voted for. Revolution please.
1	This just means the stage is being set for the fulfilment of prophecy.  Britain a protestant nation had to remove itself from the EU pack of catholic nations.  The nations which will help usher in the Anti-christ are all catholic.... part of the original 10 nations which is a part of the Roman empire.
1/1	This kind of reporting instigates trouble no matter what camp you are in.If remain had won we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation because the result would have been accepted.Why on earth remainers cannot accept a democratic vote doesn‚Äôt say much for our democracy
1/1	This makes a no-deal/WTO Brexit even more likely. Bye bye EU üëãüëã
1/1	This man is right. we voted OUT, if they don't want a Deal, they do not get the money!
1/0	This man is so stupid as to not understand why older people voted brexit. If England is better off as a part of the EU, they would have voted to stay. They are the ones who remember. TED is a leftist nation propaganda machine, nothing more.
0/0/0	This may come as a surprise to many Brexiteers but you were always going to have a worse off deal than the one you have with the EU now.
1/0	This more than anything. We need the EU because our governments are often irresponsible
0/0	This morning as I reached for my inhaler I'm very thankful I don't live in the UK. I'd be worried sick I'd not be able to get the right medication. Not being able to breathe can really affect your overall quality of life* #Brexit #RevokeA50
1/1	This open border does not allow us to check and control people
1/1	This place we call home was not, and never will be a REGION OF EUROPE--it is a place called THE BRITISH ISLE
1/1	This remoaner bilge is tiresome. It is a lie that there is a silent majority for remain, it is simply not true that those who didn't vote want to stay in the EU. We had a national vote, the turnout was excellent and the result conclusive. Non voters chose not to take part, we know nothing about their views. If remoaners insist on counting them it simply shrinks their share from 48% to 34%.
0/0	This so called UK Government should be dismissed for gross incompetence and misconduct...what an unbelievable State we have become!
1/1	This video does not tell the full story. Immigration is a secondary factor to leave the EU. The primary one is making sure Britain remains a fee and independent country and does not become a province of a United Sates of Europe. This is the main reason we will be going and not return.
1/1	This video proves how moronic remainers are. We need to leave the evil EU!!
0/0	This vote FOR Brexit was TrumpTarded. Idiots for rialed up by stupid false racist propaganda and voted for a terrible decision w clear thinking people staying at home & not voting. They should have the core again. If Brexit wins carry on. If it gets overturned then drop it.
0/0	This was a sad day
0/0	This was always going to happen and was seen by all remainders. Only the blue passport gang would deny this was always on the cards.
0/0	This was never going to work out. The people promoting Brexit all left after they won and left the pro EU people deal with the outcome. This referendum was dumb to start with. The EU has its issues, but breaking it up won‚Äôt fix it.
0/0	This was not a political revolution. the leavers got absolutely nothing. they've admitted that this will not stop immigration, they've admitted that this will not save the NHS, they've given Boris Johnson the Prime Minister title - he's more right wing than Camron and will cut a lot more then him, they've divided divided the UK more then ever, Scotland is sure to leave. Oh and obviously the housing market will crash again.
0/0	This was not democracy. The Brexit leaders are admitting they misled ppl Many ppl used vote as protest against Gvmt
1/1	This was one of the proudest moments of my life. Britain woke up in time.
1/1	This was the best birthday ever. for 9 years i had been shouting at the tv asking where was my referendum whenever the was governent on tv.
1/1	This what we been saying all the time. We will be better of outside the EU. A lot of the other big Countries will not be.
1/1	This whole Brexit charade tells us a couple of things... The EU is worse than we thought and wants to punish us for voting leave.
0/0	This whole Brexit was a conservative policy, so lets get another party in office who doesn't believe in it and save our economy. We can fix most Brexitiers problems. Enforce the WTD which will lead to lower cost homes, less Europeans coming as they won't be able to work anymore hours than other EU countries. Zero hour contracts will end as employers tie staff in, people will have social time so pubs and other social activities will grow including family time and so on. Yes, we will still pay ¬£8b a year, but if the Banks and the car industry take ¬£1 Trillion over to Berlin/EU as planned, it will take 125 years offset just that and not 50 years like Mogg says, just consider the tax and reinvestment of our money being moved across will stay in the EU.
0/0	This whole brexit fiasco is already in chaos
0/0	This whole brexit thing is like watching someone who decided to shoot themselves in the foot for no good reason endlessly debate whether they should seek medical attention or just keep on shooting and see if things get better.
0/0	This whole referendum is a smoke screen. People should unite and live in peace. Nationalism through history caused only destruction. Vote stay and lets make the EU strong and prosperous!
1/1	This will be SKI News with more Scaremongering or reporting on something that could go wrong if we leave this Corrupt EU..Don't listen to the scaremongering it's been happening for many years. Brexit will make the UK stronger..
0/0	This will be a mess.
1/1	This will be the perfect year if Donald Trump gets elected, Hillary Clinton gets arrested, the European Union dissolves, and Scotland gets independence.
0/0	This will be viewed as a huge victory. That each household has saved ‚Ç¨7 to travel, when brexit is still going to cost each household thousands each year! ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è
0/1	This will end in tears, and it was so foreseeable.
0/1	This will harm all countries and citizens involved for years to come.
0/0	This will slowly lead to the collapse of the uk
1/1	This year we had net immigration which equated to a city the size of Newcastle, next year it could be a city the size of Manchester and there is not a thing we can do about it so long as we are in the EU. No wonder the people using A&E increased by 14% in just one year and next year immigration will be even greater following the increase in the living wage which is a massive draw for those in Eastern and Southern Europe. Our hospitals cannot cope, our schools cannot cope, we do not have enough houses and eventually there will be not enough jobs. We must stop this madness and get out now and at least we can then decide who comes into our country and the numbers. At the moment we can do precisely nothing, whatever Cameron and Corbyn tell us.
0/0	This. There are towns in the UK that are so poor they have had millions poured into them by EU development grants and Farmers who depend on EU subsidy to survive. Still they lobbied and voted BREXIT. Fucking idiots.
1/1	Those who chose not to vote, have no right to complain about the consequences of their inaction
1/1	Those who don't want us to leave are the immigrants who have not taken out British Citizenship such as, Romanians, Bulgarians, Polish & Muslims because they don't want to lay the costs of becoming a British Citizen!
0/0	Those who saw the vote as a protest against poverty are now experiencing the thin end of the wedge of inflation from a falling pound
1/1	Those who say No Deal is bad say it because they want the UK to give away it's best negotiation tool. Why? - because they want to reverse the democratic vote and to remain in the EU
0/0	Those who voted for leave will cry the most in the future.
1/0	Those who were concerned about the effects of uncontrolled immigration on jobs, wages, housing, public services and the welfare of their children were smeared as 'racists'
1/0	Though no deal brexit would be the worst thing to happen
1/1	Threaten the EU to make UK a tax Haven, you would soon get Company's moving over to the UK. Not my idea of business but to hell with the EU.
0/0	Through commonly agreed EU standards, national Governments have achieved improvements to the quality of air, rivers and beaches. Good for Britain and good for Britons holidaying or living abroad!
1/1	Throughout all Europe, we are more than proud of the Brits for having escaped the European tyranny.¬†Let's hope numerous nations will follow you up!
0/-1	Thundering, thankyou, and needed today. It's sinking in, the vile culture already emanating from the new headmistress at number 10 and her cabal of disgraced or lying or incompetent or nasty appointees. What a sermon, what a finger wagging croak from the unelected head of government. As for the disgusting corbyn and his followers, no better. Shrieking about democracy while ignoring the voters at large in the country. And I am hoping the signs of some fightback will grow: against the bully boys of ukip and the anarchists of the left and the self enriching crowd of bankers' friends who believe they can ride their coach and horses back to an authoritarian past. It's getting so reason and balance is being choked out by these people who have been getting away with it for a few years now.
0/0	Tiddy "...the UK will be the only country in the World to have voluntarily regressed and made itself poorer..." Well, there is Venezuela...
1/1	Time for May to resign leading to a new election. Hopefully BREXIT supporters will win a majority in the new Parliament. BREXIT!
0/1	Time for a people‚Äôs vote to break the further deadlock so we can attempt to drag ourselves out of this mess with a little damage as possible.
0/0	Time for some democracy. Let the people vote on the deal or to remain. Why are the Brexiters so afraid of another vote? Because they know that, having seen the facts, the people will not vote to be poorer. They will vote to remain. We are staying in the EU.
1/0	Time for the grown-ups to stop this Brexit nonsense. Let's strengthen Europe and look at the real issues of our time.
0/0	Time to act to "Take back control, Time to Vote Remain"!!!
1/1	Time to front the bullies, take charge, and walk away
0/0/0/0	Time to get the Irish passport then
1/1	Time to learn to stand on your own two legs again, to relearn what it is to be an independent, sovereign nation, that gets to decide your own direction and future.
1/1	Time to leave
1/1/1	Time to leave people.
1/1	Time to leave!
1/1	Time to regain our courage to make Great Britain great again
0/0	Time to respect the will of the people......and stay in the EU.
0/0	Time to save remain. We must not allow remain to be thwarted. Brexit is a lunatic idea with catastrophic consequences and must be prevented.
1/1	Time to start stamping passports and reducing immigration, not to invoke article 50 to negotiate with people who have already said they will not negotiate. Better to negotiate from inside than outside. With regards to the forthcoming down votes, perhaps they should leave and go and live in the EU if they love it so much.
1/1	Time to tell the EU 'no decent Brexit deal, no ¬£39 billion'. We need to say it and mean it and show them the UK can make threats too.
1/1	Time to walk away and give the EU the 'finger' they deserve.
1/1	Time to walk away.... no deal is perfect
1/1	Time will tell, but if you do the research, you'll see that leaving was the best for Britain! Good job! Glad to see you regain your Independence and democracy - "we the people" have spoken!!
0/1	Tired of hearing re #Brexit that ‚ÄòThe Great British Public will pull through‚Äô ‚ÄòWe are a resilient nation and have been in tougher spots‚Äô etc..  All true, of course we will eventually. But why the hell are we putting ourselves through this? This isn‚Äôt what was promised!
0/-1	To all of the people here supporting a on deal Brexit - do you have any idea of the kind of havoc it would wreak? If so, can you please explain to me what kind of reward you expect from Brexit that would make bearing the chaos that comes after a no deal leave of the EU OK?
1/1	To all the Project Fear scaremongers running around spreading fear of Britain starving the morning after Brexit.¬†India's got Britain's back. Punjab - the world's most fertile land of the five rivers, granary of the world, breadbasket of a billion people.¬†Bring on Brexit!
0/0	To all the leavers, did you honestly think you could trust the brexiteers? Just look at them, most of them are abject cunts who think the poor should be killed off. IDS, Rees-Mogg, Farage.  When was the last time you heard a leading brexiteer talk about poor people in anything other than disparaging language?
0/0	To be brutal, I'm 65 and I have fewer years left than those young people who should have the right to the kind of travel freedoms and opportunities as I had when I was younger. No way I'd deprive them of that.
0/0	To be fair, the problems with Brexit do not really stem from the decision itself. It's the fact that it was so unexpected, so when you add incompetency and conflicting interests all of a sudden, it ends up like this. If it was a decision supported by an actual majority of population and politicians and was planned ahead, it would look different.
1/1	To be honest... EU is worst that can happen to the world... massive left totalitarism. Yes to Brexit!
0/0	To call the EU a communist state proves you don't know what communism is. It's closer to an USA then it is to the USSR
1/1	To claim that Brexit is the fault of "misinformed right wing" politicians is twoddle. Plenty of the left in Britain wanted out and not because they were misinformed but because they were fed up of the twisted democracy in which the EU operates. It was the right decision and this video truly comes across as propaganda for the centrists and the left making the right out to be manipulative villains of the people.
0/0/1/0	To fellow Americans watching this video, things can be best summed up like this: People in favor of Brexit are Trump supporters.
0/0	To hell with brexit.
0/0	To leave the EU at this time in history would be a pathetic paranoid whimpering protest at thin air causing irreparable damage #voteremain
0/0	To leave the EU would be the worst thing that could happen right now
0/0	To leave would be ludicrous
0	To leave would be the worst thing right now
1/1	To me I am happy the UK are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
1	To remain in the dreadful elitist experiment called the EU is a race to the bottom for all honest hard working taxpayers as the elite will flood the nations with mi grants which in turn will break down our individual fantastic diverse countries and turn Europe into a mass melting pot which will then make the masses easier to control. And the rich will get richer. It stops now.
1/1	To summarize, we get control back of our own country.  We get to decide immigration, not Brussels. So potentially we can almost completely stop immigration, or use Australia's points based system.  Get rid of tons of pointless laws on various products, which big business loved, but which tends to kill off smaller innovative startups.  Decisions won't be made by non-democratically elected bureaucrats in Brussels.  Not sending countless millions to the EU every week.  A chain reaction. If other countries also have an EU referendum, they also may get to leave too. The EU may die as a result.
1/1	To the people crowing about how horrible this is that the UK is leaving the EU, I wonder where they were when the EU was taking the UK's money but giving them nothing in return.
0/1	To those people who have been swayed by the murder of Jo Cox I say this--The things that originally made you consider voting Leave are still there-The mass of migrants is still hammering at the door-The Eu is still intent on controlling every aspect of your life and will up it's demands if you vote remain.
1/1	To those resentful of the result: Please Google European army. Please try and imagine where that could lead a few years from now with the wrong president(s) in Brussels. Please also bare in mind that you have no vote at all over who is president in Europe.
0/-1	Today I went to see a doctor. It was FREE. If we have a no deal #BREXIT, the NHS will die, and you‚Äôll have to pay to see a doctor. End it today. Call your MP
0/0	Today a young person hoping to go to University may chose to study at any University within The European Union. The cost of studying here is ¬£9000 a year. The cost of studying in Holland, for example ( where lectures are given in English ) is ¬£1200 a year. Total cost for a 3 year course in Holland : ¬£3 600. Total cost for a 3 year course in The UK : ¬£27 000. Tell me that hundreds of thousands of young voters, your children, will be better off if we leave The European Union.
0/0	Today is a glorious day were leaving the EU this is the start of the UK going right down hill from hear on, the poor will get poorer the rich will get richer supermarket prices will go up there will be more poverty. Good bye safe doing ok Britain. Hello dangerous Chaotic and poorer Britain.
0/0	Today is polling day. Vote for hope over fear, and because we need to build bridges, not burn them. #VoteRemain.
0/0	Today some British bank announced it was moving 190BLN of assets out of the UK to Ireland, because of Brexit.
0/0	Today's the day! Britain is #StrongerIn - so #VoteRemain. If we vote to leave, there's no going back. Don't risk it
1/1	Today, the U.K. is the most bad ass region on the planet - a model for the rest of the world.
1/1	Tomorrow we will see all the pollsters coming out with their predictions and Osborne continuing his lying with Cameron close behind. PLEASE REMEMBER If the UK remains in then political union and the demise of the UK as a country will be inevitable VOTE LEAVE to save your children's and your children's children's future from a despotic dictatorship lead by the unelected prolegariat based in Brussels
0/0	Tomorrow, Britain needs to stand tall and #VoteRemain to protect the NHS, schools, workers rights and the economy. #EUref
0/0	Tonight, as the cold descends, there are people sleeping and dying on the streets of our cities in unprecedented numbers. While hateful, solipsistic narcissists drive the country ever onwards towards the needless catastrophe Brexit. Great God in Heaven, that makes me angry.
1/1	Too many Remainers' stupid analogies !! ‚ò∫üòäüòÄüòÅüòÇ
0/0	Tories against Brexit
0/0	Tories cut public funding, the EU increases public funding. Idiots vote to leave because of public funding cutd
0/0	Tories talks about the people's choice yet the only leavers they are listening to are the rich, upper class, prejudice pricks who have never worked a day in their life
0/0	Total waste of time and money! For a deal that will be worse than we have right now!!!!
1/1	Totally biased video for the stay campaign.....................Brexit is the only way to go,and go before we lose everything,which is what will happen if we stay...
0/0	Totally depressing result, a sad day for Britain, the EU and future generations.....
0/1	Trading on WTO rules, is not frictionless trade.
1/1	Translate: You are one of those who loves Europe but loathes the glorious fascist EU and who refuses to recognise that our powerful and mighty EU will triumph over your puny democracy! Feel our EU jackboot in your face, vote-lover!
1/1	Translation: "The world never existed before the EU, and without it photosynthesis will cease and all volcanoes will erupt. It's simply impossible for a country to exist and not be a part of it."
1/0	Travel to your nearest airport, Pick a country, I recommend Benidorm as it is already filled with dumb British people so most of us will feel right at home, Never leave.
1/1	Treason May all her actions make sense if you think on the premise she was out to sabotage Brexit
1/1	Treason May is trying her level best to sell out UK and sink Brexit. If Brexit gets postponed beyond 29th March, it will be a stab in the back of Brexiters and death of democracy.
0/0	True - it is not about "believing the EU above the UK" it iabout beliving in the UK as part of the EU. No different from Yorkshore as part of England or Wales as part of the UK. If you feel different you have no right to argue at all about further power to the devolved assemblies or their total independance from the UK
0/0	True to the best, wise from our worst, for the UK there is no retreating from the EU, the world, the future.
0/0	True. As a Californian I can say, with certainty: The only thing worse than an uninformed legislator making law is an uninformed citizen making law. Majority rule becomes mob rule (it's also how our legislature often ducks responsibility)
1/1	True. The European Union is like a giant toilet pull where Muslims come to take super liquidy diareah shits. And you fuckers are stuck in this giant toilet bowl until you find a way out.
0/0	Truly extraordinary - 34.9% believe it would be "good for Britain' to leave the EU with no alternative arrangements in place. That the Vote Leave campaign has been able to persuade such a significant portion of the electorate that having substantially all our very extensive cooperation agreements with our nearest neighbours, close allies and largest trading partners simply fall away would be positive is simply baffling. So self-evidently ridiculous.
0/0	Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.?No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave.
0/0	Trump and Brexit are part of the same right-populist resurgence that has been going on all around the developed world.
1/1	Trump loves the UK more than May loves the UK. At least someone says it clearly.
0/0	Trumpism and Brexit were rich man's revolution with populist mascarade at the cost of poor and old generation left-behinders. who thought that Donald Trump, Farage or Rees-Mogg care about them.
1/1	Trust Thatcher's Guru and Vote OUT ! OUT ! OUT ! on the 23rd ! Make it OUR Independence Day !!!
0/0	Try being Irish and watching what's going on. England is now fondly referred to here as our "old enemy" but our bond and cultural similarities have never been stronger in recent years. The Queen visited in 2011 and the relationship went from strength to strength. We are now (as it was throughout history) referred to as the "Irish problem" when speaking about the backstop. But the truth is we have always been aware of the English upper class arrogance and watching from here has been very frustrating. We are now directly going to be affected by the arrogance of the "Britannia rules the waves" mentality and we had no say. Thankful that Europe has had our back and hopeful that they will still have it once this goes completely pear shaped if certain people have their way.
0/0	Trying to blackmail everybody to accept May's deal. Pretty obvious why it's being done.
1/1	Trying to reform the EU is like trying to reform Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. The EU is rotten from its core. It is a totalitarian bureaucratic dictatorship.
0/-1	Turkey will join... WE NEED TO VOTE TO ALLOW THEM TO JOIN. IF WE REJECT THEM THEY CAN'T ENTER. To join ALL EU States must agree to the member joining the EU.
0/0	Turns out Brexit did not bring more security and stability. Who knew! Opportunity for a recession is still a big selling point I guess...?
0/0	Two vanished comments in this thread already. How come we remainers get pelted with abuse by the brexiteers,but when i call them idiot potato-headed thugs i get deleted. They can‚Äôt take what they deal out to others. Cowardly Brexiteers. The UK hasn‚Äôt been so divided since the civil war.
0/1	Two weeks later they vote for it again and get outraged that the non existing flying pigs wont respect democracy.
0/1	Two women have collectively destroyed Europe, and they are still in positions of authority!
1/1	Two years of project fear. Don‚Äôt let them win. This is what people need to know. Out means out 221747 it‚Äôs a Petition for out!
1/1	Two years. of government and wrangling over deal or no deal , this government has wasted thousands of taxpayers money also waisted time, because they couldn't come up with a decision , the decision was Made at the beginning by the democratic referendum result, no deal . What a disgrace .
0/0	Typical anti-EU propaganda.
1/1	Typical unelected Remaniac who wants to use every undemocratic deceit and cheat to subvert democracy. In the short term they may succeed but in a few years the political parties across Europe will be anti-EU. Even Germany.
1/1	U have Ireland.  If Britain want to trade with EU, they can just walk to Ireland to trade. They're not that far away from EU. It's just right next door.  No big deal.  I say it's a smart move.  They can do what they want and trade.
0/0	U.K IS DOOMED............leave while you still can,the place is finished.
1/1	U.K. Independence Day should be a national holiday.
1/1	UK IS BETTER OF ON IS OWN.. THANK YOU BRITAIN for leading by example .. u guys are going to be ok.. next make GOD a priority and the ppl of God..
1/1	UK OUT OF EU!
1/1	UK SHOULD LEAVE and Germany should do so too. I respect French culture, but France has no taste for politic and economy. That's why France tends to make united organizations like OECD, EU. „Éª„Éª almost forgot, German mates, you should never vote for Merkel
0/0	UK based suppliers - lead-time increase from 5 days to 4-6 weeks  due to custom capacity shortages
0/1	UK cant leave because WTO wants a border in NI or between Britain and Irland ! UK must choose !

1/1	UK doesn't need EU like Germany or France
1/1	UK get out of EU . Eu already said that was the only deal that u will get . U take it or u leave
0/0	UK government keep rejecting calls for a second referendum. The best we can hope for at the minute is that the EU keep rejecting May‚Äôs ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù so that we end up in a political limbo. Worst thing is if May just throws her toys out of the pram, builds a wall separating NI and ROI and thus voiding the Good Friday Agreement. And we don‚Äôt want that. We still love you Ireland.
1/1	UK grow a set and just leave NO DEAL WHATSOEVER What is the EU gonna do, attack you?
0/0	UK has always been my favourite place to go. For over a decade now. But I think it's about time to say bye to my favourite country and take my money elsewhere. Good luck to you all!
0/0	UK has full control over it's money, they did not need Brexit. They had full control already.
1/1	UK has left the poor county EU now the Brits can enjoy with no head aches from bailing other countries from their misrible problems, thanks UK for being smart
1/1	UK has left the poor county EU now the Brits can enjoy with no head aches from bailing other countries from there misrible problems, thanks UK for being smart

0/0	UK is essentially cutting it's nose to spite the face.
0/0/0/0/0	UK is essentially cutting it's nose to spite the face. Brexit will bring nothing but hardship and economic and political problems and it will hurt both sides - but UK much more than EU.
1/1	UK is getting ready to surrender its sovereignty and be governed by UNELECTED and UNACCOUNTABLE WTO bureaucrauts from Switzerland!
0/0	UK is now the laughing stock of Europe
1/1	UK is the country that needs less from EU and was the most visioned country to live and work
1	UK is the richest and strongest ¬†member of EU. We are a world power. ¬†It's better for UK to form it's own union with the Commonwealth states. UK with Australia and NZ. We can then have better control of immigration, trade and money. A much better alternative than trash EU!
1/1	UK just got away from Future Northern ISIS...
1	UK made the right choice. Long live the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
0/1	UK must break up to avoid civil war.
0/0	UK need Eu more than Eu need UK
1/1	UK needs to get out of EU and take back control. Needs a shrink and a long long time to heal.
1/1	UK needs to leave the EU - everything will be the same. Trade/Travel/etc EXCEPT UK will better control its boarders! UK get your sovereignty back! It is most important, without that YOU DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY!
1/1	UK never fully embraced the EU anyway. ¬†Didn't switch to the Euro and many other things.
1/1	UK out of the EU is a good thing, for Germany at least and most members, UK is too much a special snow flake so let them rely on the banking sector. Nothing can go wrong.
0/0	UK politicians will always blame the EU, but themselves. Brexiteers would blame anyone, but themselves. Start taking responsibility for the mess you have made out of UK and the world. There is still time to stop it
0/0	UK should do new votings...will BREXIT be accepted by the people again?? I am not sure....
1/1	UK should leave, they did great before EU crapheads.
1/1	UK should now become fully independent and be the light in this dark world and the powerhouse economy of the world through proper manufacturing and business deals and NOT Through Banking and Speculation Trades.All the Best for the Uk.
0/0	UK should stay in the EU, they need to grow and become a super-power once again. EU is not a Super-power without Britain.
0/0	UK should've stayed. All those who wish ill for europeans are happy about you leaving. The Russians, the Arabs, the Chinese... wrong move. Now you're isolated and alone. What's it worth?
0/0	UK stands at the crossroads - either cancel Brexit or ending up as puppet of Putin and Trump
0/0	UK told by EU council that Brexit won‚Äôt work. What a fucking surprise
0/0	UK trying to kick everyone but Europe still allows them free movement
0/0	UK want to get out from EU and expect EU give them a better deal?? That's a bunch of non-sense expectation. If EU gives UK better deal, then more and more country will bail out, basically, kill themselves
0/0	UK was one of the countries I wanted to work as a researcher in the future. Now that is out of the EU, I'll have to focus on other countries. UK has just lost a bunch of important future workers with high GPD.
0/1	UK was the biggest recipient of Marshall Plan aid. Received much more than W. Germany. You appear not to know basic European history. Small wonder Brexit excites you.
1/1	UK was the second highest net contributor to the EU's budget after Germany

1/1	Udder! Udder! pretentious midget, talks way too much, loves the limelight, thinks he's witty, he's just a mouthy midget living high on the hog. BREXIT or bloody revolution.
1/1/1	Uk better without Europe, richer too!!! Only UK and Germany have good economies, the rest are parasites bleeding the big 2 dry!!!! 350 million a week to stay in the EU, the rebate is chickenfeed!!!!
0/1	Un fucking believable what you gonna say to the influx on high skilled indians taking our jobs ?
1/1	Unbelievable discussion... The chance for those in ‚Äòpower‚Äô to give ‚Äòpower‚Äô to the people is now. The Brexit vote goes to the heart of that. People voted to be given control over their laws, borders and money. So let‚Äôs stop talking about it and deliver it.
0/0	Unbelievable that Brexiters think the EU can threaten the EU with not paying the ¬£39bn... it means nothing to the EU.
0/0	Unbelievable, just as unbelievable anything to do with brexit has been. This nonsense must end soon, brexit has failed on all counts.
0/0	Under May‚Äôs plan, the size of the UK economy would be 3.9% smaller after 15 years, compared with staying in the EU, assuming some trade frictions and net zero inflow of EU migrants, according to an analysis by the UK Treasury.
0/0	Under any scenario, the UK‚Äôs exit from the European Union will leave the country worse off.
1/1	Understand this remaining fool. The economy was way down the list of reasons we voted to leave. Understand this remaining fool. It still is. Control of our borders, our laws and our lives came long before any financial risk
1/1	Unelected bureaucrats making it difficult to leave their Union
0/0	Unfortunately it will happen and it will be most unpleasant. An orgy of blitz inspired chauvinism and anti european sentiment.
0/0	Unfortunately, more and more people in the EU are voicing joy about the UK leaving. It's a sad state of affairs, totally on the head of reckless Brexiteers. Maybe to should be taken to court for treason.
1/1	United Europe turned into a dictatorship.  The leave vote was a great decision.  Britain is once again democratic.  Let's be clear it is not the voters that forced Britain to leave the EU,  it was EU that forced the voters
1/1	United Europe turned into a dictatorship.  The leave vote was a great decision.  Britain is once again democratic.  Let's be clear it is not the voters that forced Britain to leave the EU,  it was EU that forced the voters.

0/0	United we are,better we are,no brexit..
0/0	Unless the British government changes its stance on Brexit sharpish I don't imagine that the uk as we know it will exist in ten years. If Theresa May wants to be remembered as the PM who destroyed the UK then she should keep to her present course. If that's not how she'd like us to think of her in our dotage then a new approach would be wise.
0/0	Unless you are a Farage or Rees Mog, and have plenty of cash riding on the outcome, the results are a disaster.
1/1	Unraveling of the EU wouldn't lead to the dissolution of the EU. It'll become something like the Eurzone, a club of nations where there's no rules other than the whims of the German Chancellor
0/0	Until the government solidify a position of what post EU Britain will be and what they are going to change their are no pros that are in anyway measurable or even realistic at this stage.

0/0	Vernon Dursley would vote #Brexit , do you really want to be on the same side as him
0/0	Very few of the people who voted for Brexit will realise the cost of Brexit. Once it becomes impossible to deny things have got worse, their media will find a non-Brexit scapegoat. A news outlet whose demographic is strongly Brexit isn't going to tell their readers Brexit (and therefore their own action) ¬†is the cause of their problems. The readers won't accept it, they'll just switch to someone with a different story that doesn't make them feel bad.
0/0	Very few people understood what they were voting for

0/0	Voting for Brexit is like voting for TRUMP.
0/0	Voting for Brexit was the second worst voter decision in history.
0/0	Voting remain because the EU brought better human rights is like voting for Labour because it brought the NHS.
1/1	Voting remain won't even maintain the weird status quo we have at the moment which is the result of brushing all sorts of dreadful issues and decisions under the rug until we have voted. Anyone who votes remain will watch a horror unfold as Europe shafts us before falling apart.
0/0	Voting to leave just because of immigration is a really dumb thing to do, you have to look at the others ways, at economic reasons it would be better to stay in the EU, since many migrants pay more taxes than british people.
1/1	Voting to leave, voting for a United Kingdom, voting for self government, voting for a say in the laws and policies my government brings in, voting for no taxation without representation, voting for accountability for laws brought in, voting for control of the borders to keep out foreign criminals and terrorists, voting to control the numbers of economic migrants to the UK, voting for self determination, voting for my country, voting for liberty, voting for our laws, voting for the right not to be ruled by foreigners.
1/1/1	Voting to remain in the EU is like chickens voting for KFC.
1/1	Vox  You didn't mention the Eu also controls the 60% of laws and wish to have more power.  The right to be governed by the people you elect is what England voted for.

1/1	WE do not need the EU ,we will be better of out of this club ,that is run by Greedy OLD men that think they OWN our Country and think they can tel us how to run our lives ,ROLL ON BREXIT DAY
1/1	WOW--Where did all the LEADERS and INFLUENCERS GO---As LEAVING THE EU caused our TITLED COMMENTATORS to desert the UK, because now we REAL BREXIT BRITONS will have no one to show and demonstrate our superior mental agility and knowledge.---Ah -almost forgot--there is still the matter of stopping a certain EU tyrant called Martin Selmayr --who ( allegedly ) had a Grand father who was jailed for war crimes, this Mr Selmayr as given himself the top job by the side of Mr Juncker as 2IC to the EU executive.---He is a NOTED ANGLOPHOBE-- a man with no liking of Great Britain or America--no doubt fully due to the good flogging the war time Allies gave to the arrogant NATIONAL "Socialist" hierarchy of Hitlers German war machine.--Some Memories take a long time to disappear, and no doubt Britain's past success's will be a hard bit for Herr Selmayr, and many other EU officials, to swallow.
1/1	WTF is the point of having a vote if the result isn't honoured?
1/1	WTO is the way to go
1/1	WTO, the way to go!¬†No foreign power making 70% of our laws.¬†No undemocratic Empire.¬†Nobody telling us who can live here.¬†No British blood spilt on whatever Imperialist adventure the Grande Armee Morgherini embarks on.¬†I humbly suggest other captive nations examine the implications of their own predicament.

0/0	Wales &Scotland DO NOT WANT BREXIT and much of N.Ireland if wasn't for the Ulster loyalist to the crown. REVOTE have another REFERENDUM!! The first was like 2016 USA presidential election where nearly 25% or more didn't vote LAZY thinking the crazy impossible would never get selected.

1/1	Walk away now!!!
1/1	Walk away, pay NOTHING. What can Barnier or the EU do about it? Nothing but weep. Absolutely sick oft these EU nasties, Everything that has happened over the past few weeks demonstrates that we are right to just GET OUT.

1/1	We DO want to "crash out" with NO DEAL. Were going to be fine! We need to get rid of these crooked MPs first!!
1/1	We Leavers are not interested in what Adonis thinks or wants, he‚Äôs a bit late we had the Referendum in 2016 and this is just an excuse to stop Brexit. Well, if you spit in the face of 17.4 million voters who won the Referendum don‚Äôt be surprised when there is a monumental backlash. BEWARE WHAT YOU DO.
0/0	We NEED SECOND REFERENDUM early election/ new government "Labour " and remain in EU & stop the disaster üò†üò†üò¨üò¨
1/1	We The People have done it before, and will overcome oppression once more by leaving.
0/0	We all had the right to live or work anywhere any Europe, until we voted to lose this. My son will never know this freedom.
0/-1	We all know that Brexit is bad for the EU.
0/0	We already are a sovereign country, which is why we can make the decision to leave in the first place. All this decision has done is make the UK the laughing stock of the world.
1/1	We already decided to leave. So leave without deal. We heard a lot of scaremongering. We voted to leave.
0/0	We already had a People's Vote. I voted for remain and lost. I respect the result. Politicians should do the same.
0/0	We already have a movement like that. It's call the European Union. I suggest you start supporting it.
0/-1	We already have the best possible deal
0/0	We already have the best trade deal we‚Äôre ever going to have with the EU, and we now know we‚Äôre walking away from that in March next year.
1/1	We already know they don't care about us, they just want to keep us under thier thumb so they can drain us dry. We must leave asap without a deal, keep our money and regain everything we've lost.
1/1	We already voted out so no deal it is. This is so biased against democracy it‚Äôs laughable
0/0	We always said - long before the idea of Brexit took shape - that it is in our interests to have a united, strong, and most importantly independent European Union
0/0	We are all going to die if we leave the eu.
0/0	We are being ignored as are the majority of people . Brexit is not the will of the people.
1/1	We are better off without each other and the EU can run free with it's huge north/south divide and mass youth unemployment.
0/0	We are cancelling Brexit, get over it.
0/0	We are encouraging people negatively affected by Brexit to come together and demand that our voice is heard by Westminster to prevent constitutional carnage and the removal of our rights.
1/1	We are fed up with being disdained and ignored over the issues about which we feel strongly
1/1/1	We are finally leaving the EU we should be celebrating
0/0	We are free..... More like we are fucked
0/0	We are fucked! We must have a second referendum
1/1	We are fully aware that mass immigration by incompatible people is the EU's covert plan to destroy our way of life & Christianity prior to the end goal - World Government.
1/1	We are going to be an independent self governing nation again. You would do well to try it also.
0/0	We are here to say we love Europe
0/0	We are leaving EU soon, Crap
1/1	We are leaving because its the most sensible thing to do
1/0	We are looking at the mass replacement off our European sisters and brothers by Muslims invaders and Africans freeloaders our government needs hanged for treason crimes against ther native people down with the EU NOW
1/1	We are not Europeans and we don't feel European, end of!
0/0	We are not going to get a better society by pandering to racism, nationalism or the blatant stupidity of leaving the EU and trashing the economy of Britain
0/0	We are not on our own - there are millions of us - we are the majority of the country - and every political party except the Tories (who are solely responsible for this mayhem) and DUP (who have taken a bung) (and a very small group of myopic Labour MPs) want to stop Brexit so take courage and get organised to save our country from Tory perfidy and mendacity
1	We are one of the main financial contributors to the EU
0/0	We are one of them (and we design and build exhibitions all over the EU, buy one product from Belgium supplier, sell it to UK, France, Spain... and work a fair bit in Germany. Economic ‚Äòbumps‚Äô are secondary to sovereignty. We recover from the former, never from the latter.
1	We are out of Schengen, we are out of he Euro and come 29th march 2019 we are out of the Eu ... Once we are out, if the people are ever so stupid as to vote back in we would have to give up the pound. and harmonise our taxes to the Eu , the end aim is total and complete Political union . Where we are may not be totally perfect but the other direction to leaving on 29th March 2019 is one I never want to go down.
0/0	We are so fucked.
0/1	We are sorry EU, 48% of us voted to remain.
1/1	We are still apart of NATO. GCHQ, Mi5 and Mi6 are not useless. Lock down our boarders, deal with internal threats and continue giving information to shengan. Keep calm and Leave the EU.
1/1	We are still leaving the rotten EU and there is nothing you remainers can do about it!
1/1	We are ‚Äòtaking back control‚Äô
0/0	We aren't out yet my friend,and i hope to god we can yet remain. I voted to stay.
0/0	We came, we saw, we marched. Such love, unity and sunshine. Magical day.#PeoplesVote¬†#BetterTogether¬†#StopBrexit
1/1	We can all begin our own personalt Brexit right now with our individual spending preferences. Boycott EU goods and services. You know it makes sense.
1/1	We can do without a lying self-serving MP representing local constituents. Bring back Julian Brazier - a true Brexit supporter.
1/1	We can leave without a deal and pay nothing - what can the EU do about it - they will be bankrupt without our cash within weeks,
0/1	We can solve the migrant issue by leaving. Half our migrants come from outside Europe. Even if we leave wont be able to close the net migration to bellow 200,000. So no leaving will not solve the issue.
1/1	We can sue the EU for our ¬£60 Billion in assets and money under International Law and we would win.
1/1	We cannot fight from within, we tried that for many years and got nowhere. Germany and France hold too much power for us to do anything.
1/1	We cannot surrender our destiny to the unelected of Europe.
1/0	We deserve better than to be treated as a mere offshore province of an unelected, anti-democratic, corrupt pan- European bureaucracy
0/1	We didn't loose Europe, we rejected the European Union.
1/1	We didn't vote for a deal, we voted to LEAVE,
1/1	We didn't vote for deals we voted out so NO deal OUT, Eu sinister club is falling in more ways than one, it will be gone soon.
1/1	We didn't vote for deals we voted out so NO deal OUT.
1/1	We didn't vote to do deals we voted to leave the sooner we leave the sooner we get back to full employment
1/1	We do not want or need a second vote, no matter what the 'Economist' says! We voted OUT!
0/0	We don't need Extra Time. About time we blew the whistle for Full Time and cancelled the disastrous fiasco that is Brexit
1/1/1	We don't need a deal! We must LEAVE without a deal as said. Simple there is no other option.
0/0	We don't need food.We can eat fresh brexit.?
1/1	We don't need the EU.
0/0	We don't need to leave the EU to fix our problems.
0/0	We don't technically have to leave as the referendum wasn't legally binding. The government could just go for a soft brexit where they remain in the European Economic Area or just ignore the brexit and hope that the deciding 2% changed their minds.
0/0	We don't want Brexit.This will destroy the england.
1/1	We don't want a backstop, we don't want an agreement, we just want out. We want out immediately.
1/1	We don't want a bloody deal just get us out
1/1	We don't want an United Europe, under EU leadership the common man and women in all EU nation states are tired of unelected regulation. The only benefit is the visa free travel, but that also allows radicalized individuals to travel throughout Europe under the radar, it's what led to the Rotherham rapes here in the UK, The issues in Koln, Sweden becoming the rape Capitol of Europe. This vote was half to do with immigration reform and half to do with us in the middle classes being tired of being ruled by an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels where they can't even properly police the area around Brussels and have caused massive debts to be accumulated by private banks that hurt the EuroZone economically. This is a needed change, it's time to tear down the EU and rebuild the country's inside the EU to be self-sufficient while partnering with other European countries in order to maintain true stability for the common man.
1/1	We don't want out... we want out out!!! EU has cancer... get out before it spreads to the UK!
1/1	We don't want the Euro (‚Ç¨) thats why we quit. We like our Pound(¬£).¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£

0/1/1	We don‚Äôt need the UK
0/0	We don‚Äôt need to leave the EU to control immigration, Mrs May!
1/1	We don‚Äôt want the EU
1/-1	We either live in a Democracy or we Dont .
1/1	We fought a war to defend our borders. We lost the war, when we joined the former EEC, which was the brainchild of the Nazis.
1/1	We fought a war with you for independence Britain Nobody understands its importance better than America Vote #Brexit #VoteLeave üá¨üáß
0/1	We get half our membership costs back. On top of that we pay less than most EU countries
1/1	We get what we voted for and no billions go to the EU !
1/1	We grow build and prosper for ourselves again :) A brighter future ;)
1/1	We had a BREXIT in 1776. Things worked out pretty well not having a foreign power lord over us and taxing us.
1/1	We had a vote no deal bye bye EU adi√≥s amigos üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
1/1	We had an empire before the "EU" came into the picture.
1/1	We had the people's vote - called Brexit
1/1	We had the people's vote - called Brexit.
1/1	We have NO chance of a new style government whilst we are members.. LEAVE and then take control of our political elite .. The ones we can vote IN or OUT at elections‚Ä¶ But if we remain than bad government is what we will get forever. VOTE LEAVE
1/1	We have a massive trade deficit with the EU...we spend billions more importing than we export to the EU. If we refuse to give the ¬£39 billion, and withdraw our trade...the EU will implode and come back cap in hand begging for trade deals...this isn¬øt rocket science.
0/0	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet.
0/0	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet. If our MPs don't let the people vote on #Brexit they will be held responsible for ignoring warnings from business leaders like Tom Enders.
1/1/1	We have already voted for brexit what is this man talking about ?
0/0	We have an agreement with the Faroe Islands! What a mess. Britain seems intent on committing economic suicide but at least the migrants will stop coming when it all hits the fan, and it will hit the fan.
1/1	We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise.
1/1	We have been giving money to poor areas but via the EU after they take a massive cut. It is our money always has been. Fed up of hearing about EU funded projects. There is no such thing in this country. We are net contributors.
1/1	We have been lied to endlessly by our very own political class about the economic benefits of remaining a part of the disastrous EU project.
1/1	We have contributed a great deal to Europe in many ways and yet this is what they think of us. Doesn't this suggest we were wrong to join such a club of corrupt politicians and states continuously taking from us?
0/1	We have diplomatically voted to get rid of our paddles to take back control of our canoe
0/0	We have more influence in the EU than out of it. Stop Brexit now.
1/0	We have not changed our minds - We need our government to have a back bone and stand up for the people.
0/0	We have one year to stop Brexit happening.
1/1	We have regulations and taxes and tariffs that are meant to benefit other EU countries and don‚Äôt benefit us.
1/1	We have seen hundreds of thousands of people each year migrate from Eastern Europe to attach themselves to the UK welfare nipple.
0/0	We have to keep eu togheter if we want to ever to be great again
0/0	We have to stay in the eu
1/1	We have tried enough. time to walk away. If anyone is looking clarity tell them no deal.
0/0	We haven't left yet !!! I found your video Premature, Perhaps you should wait for the 2 years Negotiation period to be completed before bragging about Brexit , currently, not a single EU law has been replaced as result I m not surprised you believe Brexit fears have not materialized
1/1	We import a similar amount to our exports to the US so if the US were to make good on this threat to its friend and partner it would damage both economies. Basically the US is saying that it will treat us badly if we seek to regain our independence. With friends like that who needs enemies? Personally I am happy to pay whatever it takes to regain independence.
0/0	We import lots of our food from France, Spain and Italy.
0/0	We import most of our cars from France, Germany and Italy.
0/0	We import most of our oil and coal and much of our gas. How will we have enough electricity to run the freezer, or even the lights?
1/1	We in UK have delivered our verdict on leaving the EU and we do not need to be asked again...
1/1	We joined the Common Market because in the 70s the UK was a basket case. Since then the economy shifted from industrial to financial. That makes us a net customer, whereas France and Germany are net producers. While in theory France could punish us with high export tariffs, it's unlikely that they will. Global trade has become much easier in the last thirty years, and the idea of a trade block, while perhaps appropriate in the 60s, is now rather old hat. As a customer able to shop elsewhere, we have an advantage.
1/1	We just don't want to be part of this federation that has assumed more and more powers over time, without any votes or say so of the citizens.
1/1	We knew exactly what we were doing when we voted to leave, we understand the meaning of the verb ‚Äòto leave‚Äô, and what they are thinking of serving up is absolutely nothing like leaving‚Äù #brexit
1/1	We knew exactly what we were voting for. We were asked if we wanted to leave the EU and we said yes.
1/1	We leave in March, if we don't have a withdrawal agreement in place or a trade agreement so be it. That can be done outside of the EU.
1/1	We leave in March. No problem
1/0	We leave on 29th March or parliament loses all authority. They are writing their own suicide notes. This is a matter of democracy and all these remainer MPs are going to find themselves on the wrong side of history.
1	We leave regardless because we have a destiny outside vanilla Europe. They stand in our way at their peril.
1/1	We leaving about time the dirty scummy twats
1	We left I'm so happy now just hurry up with the process
1/1	We left the EU because we want to control our own borders, laws, keep our nation sovereign. We've always been the pariahs of Europe and it's natural for us to forge our own individual destiny.
1/1	We left yayyyyyy
0/0	We left........ We‚Äôre going to collapse
1/1	We liberated europe a long time ago and since then we have poured billions into their economy , its now time to liberate the UK .
0/0	We like you, Brits, but you make it difficult, considering the mess you put us all into... still, we like you. Think this thoroughly, please.
0/0	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on
0/0	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on,. Very backward way of thinking.
1/1	We make decisions for the best interests
1/1	We must leave EU immediately, I don‚Äôt want refugees to flow into our country.
1/1	We must leave the EU i don't want to deal with Article 13.
1/1	We must leave the EU.
0/0	We must not underestimate the power of the Daily Mail, the Express or the Sun. For  decades, they have fuelled intense hatred of the EU among their uneducated readers. The announcement of a second referendum will be like a red rag to a bull to them - they will launch a ferocious campaign with roaring headlines such as ‚ÄôNOW the remoaners want to steal the people‚Äôs referendum‚Äô.  The gullible readers, even those who are already suffering from inflation and job losses, will vote leave again.
1/1	We must win this referendum we must vote LEAVE! We will never get another chance
0/0	We need MPs who do their job and distantiate themselves from the nonsense that the people really want Brexit. #Brexit is a crime. There is no mandate when you win 52% on lies, stolen private data, social media high-tech and big foreign money.
0/-1	We need a #PeoplesVote. There is no other way out of this mess.
1/1	We need a general election to get the traitors out so that we can finally get the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.
0/1	We need a second referendum never allow the chavs to have a brexit
0/0	We need a second referendum. The younger generation should get a vote on Brexit because it affects them just as much
1/1	We need a strong leader who can fight Eurocorruption and cares about people and country, like Nancy Pelosi!
1/1	We need democracy to preserve our freedoms, but we should focus a lot more on the essential freedoms, otherwise even with democratic votes, you might end in a dictatorship. Exhibit A is Germany in the 1930s
0/1	We need no deal, no deal whatsover, for about 5 to 10 years. Yes, economic fur will fly for a few years, but this is absolutely necessary in order to separate out the economic aspects of leaving from the political nonsense from which we must ensure we are entirely free on Brexit day. It is not the cost of leaving the fascist superstate, but rather the cost of ever having joined the fascist superstate in the first place - send the invoice to the estate of the traitor greasy slug Heath, the traitor John Major-Ball the former circus clown and failed bus conductor, and architect of the ERM disaster, and Tony B. Liar, Labour's traitor psychopath and war criminal. Negotiating the economic and trade aspects, together with the "punishment" that we are to receive for having the temerity to leave the fascist superstate, is complete madness. The only thing to do now is to tell the fascist superstate to fwuk off. We should not have any discussions with them for at least 5 years.
0/0	We need people to come to the UK and live here for the economy to work by closing the UK off to the EU by not allowing free movement of labour this will mean more jobs in the UK? Wrong we need these people for their labour and it is wrong to assume they all are unskilled. Leaving the EU will be our biggest mistake and will cost the economy another recession and heavily impact the majority of UK citizens over the next ten years.
0/0	We need the EU because our governments are often irresponsible.
1/1	We need to LEAVE - just as stated in the referendum. WTO not this deceitful deal that Olly EU and May cooked up to keep us tied into the crumbling, discredited EU.
0/1	We need to bin the nightmare before it gets much worse.
1/1	We need to dump them NOW, whilst they're in panic mode, so we can destroy their evil empire before they destroy us and Europe!
0/0	We need to end the Brexit madness
1/1	We need to get off the sinking EU ship as soon as possible.
1/1	We need to get out as soon as possible, their true colours are emerging?.
1/1	We need to get the hated EU out of the UK now by whatever means necessary.
1/1	We need to hang in there and face the EU down.¬† No blinking until we leave and then lots of flag-waving!
1/1	We need to know and understand what's coming next after Brexit¬†( with OR without a deal ) - this is what WILL happen.¬†The EU has recognised that our country is a threat to their Superstate¬†project once again.¬†It seems that in every century their efforts to unify and rule the whole of Europe¬†is dashed by the interfering actions of the British¬†- Napoleon (19th Century), Hitler ( 20th Century ) EU Commission ( 21st Century). They will now need to crush us entirely because leaving us alone, to thrive, to prosper, to grow in power and influence, to become an economic competitor right on their doorstep simply cannot be allowed. Remember - Brexit is not just about Britain taking back control, it's also about the EU LOSING control.
1/1	We need to leave ASAP, I as many others did not vote to be controlled by Brussels. The ridiculous amount of money given to the EU every day will help our country recover especially the NHS. Now the EU is allowing the Calais migrants to use their human¬†rights to have their cases heard here so they will all head our way the same as when they drop going to the first country. Genuine Refugees fleeing horrific war zones are in genuine need of help but economic migrants are not. We need to take action and fast track our British Bill of Rights now instead of the summer. The small print though still will allow migrants to exercise their human rights. This should not be allowed in the uk once the British bill is in place. We need leaders to be strong with an iron will and lead us out of the EU I will then once more be proud to be British and no longer afraid for our future.
1/1	We need to leave before the Euro collapses and possibly the EU with it.
1/1	We need to leave now and govern ourselves. This is the way that we have succeeded so well in the past
1/1	We need to leave on WTO terms. just out of general principal.. the EU need to learn their lesson.
0/0	We need to make sure that all Brits go home after Brexit. Good bye EHIC, good bye sunshine. Hello social assitance crash.
0/0	We need to pull together not just for a Peoples Vote but to stop Brexit completely and then work so that this does not happen again. The UK badly needs healing.
1/1	We need to regain control of our laws and borders.
1/1	We need to walk away with no deal
1/1	We need to walk.
0/0	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea
0/0	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea.
0/0	We need unskilled labours. Our workforce is skilled enough as it is. Besides that if we leave 100,000s of our own citizens will have to return to our country many of which can't work. They are elderly and will put further strain on our health care.(which is one of the largest employers of migrants because UK citizens don't want to be nurses) So the NHS may crumble if we choose to leave the EU.
1/1	We never lost Europe we are leaving the EU  i thank Cameron at least he did give the people a voice  The EU has hyjacked the word EUROPE  thank god we voted Leave
1/1	We never voted for a deal,democracy must prevail. If not We will be finished as a sovereign nation.
1/1	We not need a Brexit we need a Euexit (The EU must go) !
0/0/0	We now know Brexit was rigged by Cambridge Analytica and the Russians.
1/1	We only ever voted to join the common market anyway, not what is now the EU. No wonder we want out.
1/1	We ordinary souls that do not have huge wealth to shelter us and our children want Brexit.
1/1	We owe Europe under ten million pounds, THEY owe us BILLIONS for the cost of Liberating them during WW2.
0/0	We owe the money... if we don't pay it our international reputation and creditworthiness goes down the tube...
1/1	We owe them NOTHING!!!
1/1	We owe them nothing but there will be plenty on here no doubt saying we do. How anyone can agree to giving away 39bn of hard earned taxpayers money when you look all around and see how much we need that money ourselves is beyond me. I don't even think we should pay it if we get a deal. Who in their right mind pays someone just so they can sell us their stuff? Because our exports are more outside the EU than in it. But no doubt we will because our politicians are so weak, it won't effect them but get ready for another 10yrs of austerity to pay for it
0/1	We paid nearly nothing in the bailouts compared to our GDP. Countries half our economic size were paying twice as much
0/0	We pay a lot of money to the EU in fees. For that we get right of access to western Europe and right to travel, work and live where we choose. Europe is 'Our Country' and is at peace. We get the single market and the customs union which means free trade in many countries all around the world. Its great value. We will lose all this at the end of transition and cannot replace the lost trade. Shame.
1/1	We ran the country well enough before BLAIR signed our country over to the EU the people didnt sign it over . Therefore we do not belong to it which means they have no hold over us. So we would like to leave piecefully & be left to bring our country back up to being GREAT BRITAIN again . We would like all the intruders to go back to there own countrys & fight for it not leave it to others to fight for it for them...
1/1	We really don't care any more, just get us out of this monstrosity now
1/1	We really should just leave. Mrs May, get a backbone and tell the EU what to do!
1/1	We see young people wandering on streets with no jobs. Skill them and employ them. Do not make excuses to remain in the EU
0/0	We should be fixing our problems instead of leaving the EU.
0/0	We should be shouting to stop Brexit
1/1	We should celebrate our new freedom
0/0	We should do what they say. We are going to need to stay on good terms so when the Brexit disaster fails like we said it would we can march Farage to the EU parliament to get down on his hands and knees and beg Juncker to let us back in and admit he was wrong and we might have a chance of being accepted back in.
1/1	We should do what trump said. Sue the EU . The macron led agenda against the UK is also against EU rules. Sooner we leave the better. That is why nearly all leave voters just want out now.
0/0	We should have only allowed people who can tie their own shoelaces to vote. If we had that there‚Äôd be no Brexit!
1/1	We should listen to the very people that never listened to us, well sorry but our day has come and you can do what you made us do over the decades, sit back and take it.
1/1	We should not negotiate with the EU until after we leave. There is no point.
1/1	We should stop buying German/French cars and buy Japanese or Korean ones and exchange French wines for GB/US/Australian/ Sth. American wines. The UK is a MASSIVE market and they need our pounds. Time for Made In UK stickers on all products to give consumers more information on the choices they make in the supermarket. I for one would pay a little bit extra just to stick two fingers up at the EU.
1/1	We shouldn't have become so dependent on EU systems IN THE FIRST PLACE ! Time to develop our own system and infrastructure with some of the 39 Billion saved if no deal !!
1/1	We simply must leave on WTO terms...Europe is in a federalistic mess.
1/1	We still have every chance of winning this. Vote leave!
1/1	We support Brexit here in the US. ¬†Many of us here in the US have English roots. ¬†It's your sovereign nation and you should have a say in who you let in.

0/0	We think the best thing that could happen would be a revote on the Brexit... It's weakening the English economy.
1/1	We thrived for thousands of years and became a world power because the EU wasn't around to lead us by the nose.
1/1	We understand Brexit means some pain. But it will be less painfull than the failure of the EU project when it goes down the pan ...which it will ......is!  We just won't be there picking up the bill ....Germany will.

1/1	We voted Out not for some dodgy deal that ties us to that decrepit, totalitarian state

1/1	We voted leave and we won, that‚Äôs democracy.
1/1	We voted leave because the politicians of the EU we're meant to represent us & instead they dictate us. No deal will is our better option than remaining with those who demand things. Someone who demands things from others is not an ally

1/1	We voted to LEAVE. The only way we can respect that decision to LEAVE is by going WTO but remoaner MPs are doing everything possible to destroy democracy and Brexit and want to stop us ever having a sensible deal [which is NOT treason May's deal written by her EU masters] and leave or go WTO. The only thing that will please this lot will be ''remain''. They want to destroy democracy for good in our country.
1/1	We voted to Leave, not for a deal.

1/0	We want to have our cake and eat it.
1/1	We want to leave because we are sick of paying for poor unstable countries and paying more than we get back to the EU and giving immigrants the red carpet when some of of soldiers are struggling to get by and we want our country back and I'm very angry with how they are trying to blackmail us by making us pay 50 billion to leave how about you ask those parasites you let swarm into your country pay that fee.
1/1	We want to make our own laws, control our own borders, choose our own trading partners
1/1	We want what we voted for. Out of the EU. Nothing else you can deal with us if you want but on our terms. Simple.

0/0	We were all talking about it in school and we all wanted to remain... But we can't vote so you cares... I do , it's my future
1/1/1	We were asked to vote, we voted LEAVE, thats it. The only remaining question is whether the government will honour the vote or betray the people.
0/0	We were told the Iraq War was a bold risk worth taking. It was a lie.
1/1	We will also be able to say that all our laws are made in our Parliament, by directly elected representatives, rather than having to incorporate laws made overseas in Brussels.

1/1	We won the vote to leave fair an square.
1/0	We won‚Äôt get caught up in an ever tightening union that cedes more and more power to a supra-national organisation.
1/0	We won‚Äôt have to abide by EU laws on things like workers rights, or farming standards.
0/0	We would likely be at a considerable diplomatic disadvantage because the EU would inevitably look after its own interests and any terms offered would benefit the EU first.
1/1	We're FREEEEEEEEEES AND OUT YIPPPIII
0/0	We're better together. We're kinder together. We work better together. We love and live together. Let's #VoteRemain
0/0	We're heading into a new dark age and it may be way longer this time.
0/0	We're letting xenophobic fear-mongering morons ruin not only our futures, but the futures of so many innocent people who relied on us.
1/1	We're not out yet until the Prime Minister invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, why pay 20 billion pounds a year and get less then 10 billion back, the country is being dragged down in the gutter. Thank you for your coverage, hope we do a trade deal with the USA our true partners. Socialism is the new word for slavery.
1/1	We're not the first to vote to leave or last, Greenland left back in the early 80s
1/1	We're out!!!! We did it!!! üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
1/1	We're out, and we're staying out. ;)
1/0	We've already hit 2008 levels of economic recession, just by voting to leave. This is a disaster for Britain, plain and simple
1/0	We've been in the EEC/EU for over 40 years and haven't seen much in the way of EEC/EU grants up here in the Yorkshire coalfields.
0/0	We've got Irish (North & South) ancestry & my Sister was hoping we could apply for Irish citizenship (I doubt it), if the shambolic mess goes through.
1/1	We've got free trade deals with most of the world though? The UK has one of the freest economies in the world and that's down to government policy, not the EU.
0/0	We've had a year of "will of the people" "accept the result" "Get over it" "the people have spoken" - yes we have and we say no to Brexit
1/1	We've had one and we don't need another, get us out, it's simple but we have the wrong people in charge and the choice is poor.
1/1	We've voted and sposed to be leaving...are we, we still have to fight for freedom
0/0	We, the British people, have shot ourselves in the foot
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	We, the British people, have shot ourselves in the foot.
0/0	Welcome to Brexit Britain... You did not liked the beaurocratic EU you can enjoy corrupt UK politicians, without scrutiny
1/0	Well Brexit basically just got cancelled. Hahaha
0/0	Well Brexiters keep harping back to WWII. They will enjoy the rationing of food etc. Gives them the Dunkirk spirit.
0/0	Well I hope all the brexiters will be happy, esp the old, i hope they like the cold and hunger.
1/1	Well I'm not Russian and I'm a real person of this country! I would be happy to leave with no deal and take the risk.
0/0	Well I'm not from the UK, so my opinion doesn't matter. Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
0/0	Well IMO (I'm not British) , It's dumb to let 51% decide decades of country future, that's first of all. At least 3/4 of the country should agree with these kind of decisions.  For seconds, mostly older generation voted to leave and younger wants to stay.. So it is not that elders are right or wrong, but in saying how the future is shaped I think the ones who should have more voice are the people who will be in that future let's say ~5-15 years from referendum.  And a lot of campaign let's get out was - we will get all the benefits and 0 consequences, mayyybe slight discomfort, but nah, EU will fall before our feet.. And that was complete BS. But the people who know no better still believed that.  So the second referendum is the way to go IMO - with all the facts everyone has now, the truth about negotiations, and what may or may not happen after Brexit is more clear, the people should have the last say - is that what they wanted, or the campaign leave was such a BS that it's better to stay than go through?
1/0	Well The UK voted out. Let's see how northen ireland and Scotland will will take that shall we. Also the Channel is not getting larger. So if british peoples want to leave Europe they need to learn how to make their island move... and start to row .
0/0	Well UK is setting up barriers to trade with the world.  So basically its like gravity, you minimize trade you earn less money
0/0	Well a majority of the People now wish to #Remain in the EU...but in Parl ideologues & party hacks are denying the option to test it, being more interested in imposing their will on the Ppl than the true maj Will of the Ppl.
0/0	Well anywhere Britain wants to go dealing EU is there already so !
0/0	Well done Brexiturds yet another triumph for stupidity
1/1	Well done Britain !!!!!¬† great outcome for a great future !!!!!!¬†¬† Now we need just to wait for Trump's victory in Nov
0/1/1	Well done U.K. now all other countries living under the Euroscum vote out also.
0/0	Well done UK, you have made the EU weaker, but only the EU but also yourselves and in doing so you have made Russia, China, and the US stronger.
0	Well done to Sweden..remain is the only way forward
1/1	Well even though as a Greek I know there was some British people who we're teasing Greece's economic situation and such as well as everyone else which totally wrong and disgustingly racist in all views but. I support Britain.
0/0	Well in fairness. I hope our political/economic turmoil acts as a lesson to the rest of the Europe. A lesson in what not to do.
0/0	Well my future is now officially fucked. Good job voters, not thinking about our generation. Good job.
1/1	Well over 2 years of prevaricating and now they want to delay. Being booted out of office is not enough. There needs to be some sort of retribution, starting with imprisonment
1/1	Well said. All of Britain should realize their freedom is at stake. The mask is off of the beast. Tell the EU no. Tell them to go to hell. Live free or die!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Well technically all old (65+) people voted leave which is so stupid they get to vote because they wont feel the consequences as much us younger people ALSO northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay but England voted to leave so If Brexit does happen Scotland and northern Ireland will make a vote to leave GB and Join E
0/-1	Well that hasn't gone terribly well for the UK so far, now has it?
0/1	Well the Brexiters got what they wanted.Control of their borders.And foreign investors got the message.Bye bye.
0/0	Well the UK dug this grave, so now they have to get nice and comfy in it
0/0	Well the average British citizen already fucked themselves over when they voted in favor of Brexit. Reap as ye shall sow, fuckwits.
0/0	Well the deal is shady but leaving EU seems like a fool's errand!
0/0	Well the fucknuts have won. Enjoy the shit storm that follows.
1/1	Well then tell the EU to take a Run and Jump and Let's have a no Deal.
0/0	Well this might go badly,or perhaps extremely badly.
0/0	Well those who voted for this shitstorm can fuck off to the back of the food queues.
0/0	Well to say that‚Äôs inconvenient seems like an understatement
0/0	Well, Brexit is turning out great. üòÇ
1/1	Well, I think it's safe to say that Europe is slowly dying.
0/1	Well, after so much BS, I say Europe should also have a referendum on the UK staying in. You want out? Fine: get out. And stay out.
1/1	Well, if europe and the euro are so fucking amazing you don't need to worry about anything now do you?! Kid
0/0	Well, it is crystal clear Brexit is impossible to execute, let's cancel the whole thing and get back to our lives.
0/0	Well, it's time to vote on the #EUref now remember the immortal words of Londo Mollari and DON'T GIVE AWAY THE HOMEWORLD #VoteRemain
0/0	Well, just leave then! Who needs your arrogant, backwards-minded, soon-to-be-broke asses anyway? But don't expect any special treatment, once you're out!
0/0	Well, me and my partner who is English have moved to Germany now, so do what you want. We don't have to wait months to see a doctor for 5 minutes and aren't under threat from heroin addicts in the street anymore, despite open borders and 1 million refugees.
1/1	Well........ May might not get what she wants! But carry on and us leavers will get the WTO deal that WE want!!
0/0	Well: ten months later, and Brexit has turned into a bumbling mess. Here's hoping Britain will be able to hold another referendum and stop the incoming hard exit on March 28th.
0/0	We‚Äôll need a VISA to go to Europe. Driving licenses won‚Äôt be valid. End of the roaming charges for using our phone‚Äôs abroad. All of this means that Brexit is impacting on the lives of people. it‚Äôs just becoming on huge, gigantic mess.
0/0	We‚Äôre fucked here in the UK.
1/1	We‚Äôve been here before with various German leaders threatening our Country . Ms Merkel thinks ‚ÄòBritain will need to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight‚Äô. Love her, hate her, or hate her some more, I despise this woman. These comments come from a Chancellor who single handedly, without so much as a care for any of the peoples, or Governments, of Europe, gave the green light back in 2015 for millions, yes, millions of migrants to swarm across Europe, unchecked, uncontrolled and unwanted, a situation which continues to this very day.
1/1	What A Bunch of Unpatriotic Doom Mongering Democracy Denying sore loser cry Baby Remainiacs
1/1	What BBC wont tell you......THE TRUTH !
0/0	What Brexit? Englexit! Scotland and Wales will stay in the EU and the UK will implode ... Good luck !
0/0	What I find especially amazing is how many in the UK don't seem to¬†care, or don't think it'll matter. There seems to be this widespread notion that "it'll all be ok in the end". As if the adults are going to come back into the room and sort things out. As if the rest of the world will set up some kind of safety net to bail the country out from the consequences of its own actions.

0/-1/0	What I find stupid is that I'm only 14 and this will probably affect my generation the most and some dying old sock is deciding our lifestyles. So much for 'Democratic'.
1/1	What I voted for 43 years ago and 2.5 years ago to GET OUT!!
1/1	What I would like to know is where is the Billions if not Trillions of pounds going to come from if we stay in the EU, we will need lots more Hospitals, Schools, and houses to cope with the millions of immigrants that are hell bent on coming to Britain plus the money for Doctors , Nurses and Teachers and billions of pounds per week for there Benefits, it is a lose, lose situation for the British People so VOTE TO LEAVE>
1/1	What a beautiful day, perhaps only topped by Nov 8th!
0/0	What a bloody mess! All fueled by xenophobic, paranoid imbeciles like Mogg, Trump and Farage.
0/0	What a daft announcement. Sure, I‚Äôm a remainer, I hate the idea of brexit and think it‚Äôs going to throw our economy back 50 years, but I‚Äôm quite relaxed about actual brexit day and I‚Äôm sure most of my kind are as well. Nobody s going to riot about brexit, at least nobody on the remain side. But what we all should be wary about is what comes after that as the pain starts to set in and brexit voters realise that they have been had by brexiteers lies. That‚Äôs when the 5hit will hit the fan not on brexit day.
1/1	What a despicable woman. We voted OUT DO NOT GO AGAINST WHAT WE VOTED FOR
1/1	What a filthy old fart this guy is!!.....Kick the evil, corrupt, controlling EU out of all OUR Countries now!!......Please share!
0/0	What a fucking national embarrassment these people are. It's as if they rounded up some football fans and put them in suits. Shameful. The UK is not these clowns. Sorry Europe.
1/1	What a great day for Britain. I lived there for 2 years back in the Blair era and I was hoping they would make the right choice. Now is the time to finalise everything.
1/1	What a great night that was. Stayed up most of the night to watch it
0/0	What a joke, there isn/t a good Brexit
1/1	What a load of absolute s***e!!!!! I have never once been asked to contribute to these new polls nor do I know anyone who has. I doubt anyone in the north of England (as per usual) has even been asked. WE ARE LEAVING FACT!! Why don't BBC put in the news the secret signing by the Queen herself. This cannot and will not be reversed. Get over it & tow the line tories and remoaners you've lost. FACT!
1/1	What a load of nonsense! The British voted to exit the EU. So exit! With NO DEAL. If the EU want to make that uncomfortable then UK knows who their friends are....good and strong reason to leave them in the firdt place
1/1	What a load of nonsense! The British voted to exit the EU. So exit! With NO DEAL. If the EU want to make that uncomfortable then UK knows who their friends are....good and strong reason to leave them in the firdt place.
1/1	What a load of rubbish "the peoples vote" whatever that means, The People Voted and if your democracy means anything at all , Respect them
0/0	What a load of shoemakers. Poor people who voted leave had been convinced by lying scumbags like Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson that leaving would make them better off.
1/1	What a load of windbags we had a vote it was leave if we have to vote again we will have to vote every year then when it was never right for these remainers
1/1	What a misleading video. Free trade doesn't require political integration; the video makes it look as if the UK is cutting off all trade by leaving. Also, incredibly, left out was the refugee crisis, as if the only migrants coming to the UK were European immigrants looking for work. Shame on Vox
1/1/1	What a rubbish documentary. Eveyone is anti-brexit? Hardly balanced!
0/0/0/0/0/0	What a shame, I would like to see an united Europe, as an union of nations, our economies, our armies, our people united, but all the countries having their own culture, language, and roots.
0/0	What a shower of shit out politicians are. These are crazy times; I wouldn't hold my breath for any sort of inquiry into this mess anytime soon.
0/0	What a terrible situation.
0/0/0	What a waste to get rid of all the benefits of the EU.
1/1	What about UK's share of EU community property? We must have paid a huge chunk towards those shiny new EU buildings we keep seeing in EU news reports.
0/0	What about a referendum of rejoining the EU? it will save the democracy and also can save the UK. The referendum was not about never join the EU again. Leave then rejoin one day after. IMO: Referendum of join the EU. if its fall then leave with withdraw agreement. It its not fall, then start renegotiate with the current agreements between the EU and UK. It then would be a one day technical Brexit(or even one week) followed an empowered rejoin agreement from people by referendum.
1/1	What about all the children of Europe who can‚Äôt get work because of the single currency. Don‚Äôt we owe it to them to end the madness of the EU and it‚Äôs dysfunctional currency which is destroying Europe.
0/0	What about the 16..18 years old - they weren't allowed to vote, even though it'll affect them more than anyone
0/0	What about the gained opportunity? All your companies that benefit hugely from restrictions on other countries that UK pushed trought (as one of the strongest members of EU). What about all the inteligence that can study in UK and then helps the economy...
0/-1	What an embarrassment for the uk
1/1	What annoys me is how remainers try to pretend that leave had a lot of financial backing and support. Leave won because of UKIP boots on the ground and because the people wanted out. We also won because Cameron didn‚Äôt stay neutral and remain ran such a negative campaign.¬†The British people will not react well to a Brexit Betryal.
0/0	What brexit rewards?
0/0	What can I say, a lot of Brits are dumb.
0/0	What did Britain say to its trade partners? ‚ÄúSee EU later.
1/1	What did anyone really expect? The EU is basically modeled on the Sicilian Mafia, the Commorah. Capo di tutti Capi is Merkel. They negotiate nothing, apart from other people¬øs ruin. They have inherited the same arrogant swagger once initiated by an Austrian with a dodgy moustache and who also attempted to humiliate Britain.
0/0	What do Brexiteers think of the decline of the pound?
0/0	What do we want? Stop Brexit.
0/1	What do you mean why?!  45% of export of the UK goes to the EU now, that's a fact. Trading won't stop directly after the Brexit, but then the negotiations have to start.  Leaving the EU the UK has nothing to offer except trade. UK would be at the mercy of the EU. If a deal is struck, chances are it's more beneficial to the EU then the UK.  It's difficult to say what WILL happen after a Brexit, but the EU won't be happy with a member state leaving. Difficult to say if they're willing to act on that, but it's not like it's a 1 in a billion sort of chance, it's very real.  The EU will try to do as much as they can to keep the UK in, but if you push them away, they won't easily come back.  You want me to give you credible evidence before you go into a debate, how about you show me credible evidence that the UK will be able to strike a good trading deal with the EU after the Brexit. Except you can't, no one can. Only way to do that would be to strike a deal with the EU before the Brexit.  I know one thing for sure, if the EU isn't interested, the UK is fucked. Best case scenario (but I don't know why the EU would do this) is for the EU to continue trading with the UK as it is now. Worst case, EU backs off completely, and the UK is left in a massive economic recession. Realistically they'll probably tank your economy, but then offer you a trading agreement that is better for the EU, which makes sense, since the UK would have no real bargaining powers left outside the EU.  In the end it's very simple, you told the EU to fuck off, and then you have to come back to the table with nothing new to offer. I mean what sort of deal would you even want to strike? You'd want to recoup the (little) money the UK is spending now on the EU, and just get a trading deal. Why on earth would the EU agree on that? It's worse for the EU, better for the UK, but the UK has nothing to offer to the EU apart from trade.  As a friend, and as a member of the EU, UK is a very good ally. But don't think that the UK is what makes the EU, or that the EU cannot live without the UK, then you're just delusional. The EU could live another day if they decided to stop all trading with the UK, the UK would ... not fair well.  But hey, at least no more immigration, and you can decide on your own policies. So I advise you to look into the facts and not throw away the future of your country over something as trivial as immigration or sovereignty. I won't badmouth the Brexit, as a nation you can do whatever you want, but I urge you to consider the very real possibilities that can occur on economical levels. You're not taking a gamble on your favorite football team down in the pub, it's the future of your country you're gambling with.
0/0	What ever small merit there might be in leaving the EU has been wasted by short sighted, ill conceived, jingoistic pig headedness. We will be worse off and have less influence in the world.
0/0	What frustrates me about this referendum is whatever decision 75 yr old Brenda makes, young people will be left to deal with #VoteRemain
0/0	What good could come from the Brexit
1/1	What happened to it being enshrined in law that we leave on the 29th, it proves how much of a farce these politicians are
1/1	What happened with Brexit was people taking back control.
0/-1	What have you been doing for the last two years? FFS!
1/1	What if Britain gets rid of all the outsiders and begins to flourish again? It's people will return.
0/1	What is happening to GB? A total sell out to the remainers and her bosses from the EU
1/1	What is the fuss? UK gets back control of its borders and trade. Don't see what wrong with that.
1/0	What is the point of this no one wants her deal looks like they are still not listening to the people of this country.
0/0	What is the point with this referendum??? We all want to stay in the EU
1/-1	What most remainers here don?t seem to grasp is that the eu would love a no-deal brexit.
0/0	What most voters still don't realize is that the brexit referendum was basically a choice between the U.K. being a powerful European Union member state or becoming the future 51st state of the United States of America
0	What most voters still don't realize is that the brexit referendum was basically a choice between the U.K. being a powerful European Union member state or becoming the future 51st state of the United States of America.   That is basically what it will come down to on the long term.  The world has changed a lot because of globalization and the rise of the BRIC countries.  Nostalgia for the British Empire and economic austerity over the last decade weighed heavy on the result of that referendum.
0/0	What on earth am I supposed to do now? I voted remain and I'm stuck in England. This vote has put my career plans into the shitter and made me poorer.
1	What on earth did we do for food, petrol, medicine, doctors, banks, farm workers etcetc before 1975 ? How did we survive at all ? I'd worry about Brexit if I was French, German, Belgian or a citizen of the states we've subsidized, along with EU fraud & corruption, for 40 years
1/1	What part of - THE EU DOESNT CARE DONT THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND? Can‚Äôt you see that they see us as a low level democratic people over there. We are part of a democracy and we are taking orders from non elected bureaucrats - why - because of money, because of wealth because of the economy. What about FREEDOM? What did millions of our hero‚Äôs die for? That we should give our sovereignty and Freedom over to a bunch of unelected and unapologetic tyrants. I say we BREAK AWAY. Advance Britannia.
1/1	What part of exit did you not understand? EU is doomed anyway.
0/0	What pisses me off most about the politicians playing power games with Brexit as the football, is that it won‚Äôt be them who may struggle to pay the rent or decide between food or heating or have permanent anxiety that their job will be lost. They‚Äôre immune to it all. #FuckBrexit
1/1	What problem does the existence of the EU ( club corrupt ) provide a solution to?
0/-1	What the UK is going to get is a hard Brexit, steered through by a coterie of hard-right Tory free market ideologues making decisions without any reference to Parliament.
1/1	What the UK may have lost in trade with the EU, is more than compensated with what the UK will gain in renewed trade with the Commonwealth, SADC and BRICS. New Zealand  and Australia already have trade delegations, investigating renewed trade relationships with the UK, whilst SADC would love to use British International financial expertise. The English speaking "world" is much larger, richer and much more powerful than the EU. The UK have the advantage of the English language.  This is a very powerful tool.
0/0	What the fuck are we doing. #Brexit is a choice. The wrong choice
1/1	What the heck is Brexit about if not to let the UK become the UK again. Tell the EU where they can go and make a clean break.
1/1	What they don't seem to get is this. The country voted to leave. That means if we reach the end of March and there is No Deal then that's how we leave. What the press doesn't tell you is the sheer panic in the EU countries whose economies will nose dive. All because Juncker et al. believe we won't do it. How wrong they are.
1/1	What utter rubbish, Better to have less economic certainty now rather than be conglomerated into a European superstate
1/0	What we all need most is not a mass UNITY, but a diverse HARMONY
1/1	What we are doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them ... Spain included. It‚Äôs definitely jaw-jaw
0/-1	What we can achieve when we work together is wonderful
0/0	What we need is a new party. I will vote for any party that does not support Brexit at this point.
1/0	What we were promised three years ago, is not what is being promised today! We must have a public vote to avoid destruction to British businesses and their employees. Stand up 4 Brexit
0/0	What will happen when Brexiteers realise they have been fed a pack of lies?
0/0	What will this mean to the younger generation like me, I wish we could have vote coz this affects our future too. Does this mean university or college tuition fee will go up?
1/1	What's the European Parliament ever done for us
0/1	What's the difference between Westminster & a Sewage Pit - A Sewage pit has a limit to which it can SINK!
0/0	What's the difference? The need to cancel Brexit is the thing that's screamingly obvious... The need to have had a plan before triggering article 50 was screamingly obvious.
0/0	What's tragic is that it was avoidable. Cameron should have been constitutionally unable to call the referendum.
1/1	What, you mean control of our own borders, law-making autonomy and saving millions of pounds per week? Those 'consequences'?
0/1	Whatever Brexit touches turns to dust
0/0	Whatever the outcome now, the UK will be the loser. Cur your losses and #StopBrexit
0/0	Whatever the reasons the future looks harshly worsened by leaving the EU. It is useful to try to understand voting behaviour but this utility is minute compared to that wasted by Brexit.
1/1	Whatever you feel about immigration there is a huge negative sentiment mainly driven by cheap Eastern European labour. We need to apply a meritocratic skill based approach to immigration, stop having insanely counterproductive immigration laws because the back door is wide open and stop using cheap labour to fund our economic growth at the expense of our social cohesion.
0/0	Whats idiotic is that apparently a lot of the people who voted for it are already saying they want to take it back because they were either ignorant, or they didn't think their vote would do anything.
0/0	Whats the difference between a flatearther and a brexiteer. NONE!!
1/1	What‚Äôs wrong with no deal? Australia does $100 billion a year in trade with the EU without a deal
0/0	When Brexiters say they are happy to pay any price for sovereignty...  Does that really mean they want economic collapse, jobs lost forever, businesses & young people in exodus, obscene price increases?
0/0	When I have children I'll them if they don't work hard at school they'll end up like these Leave types.
0/0	When I read pro brexit people posting their arguments I always think that has to be sarcasm, but the amount of stupidity has no limit apparently.
1/1	When I voted leave I did so to end our EU relationship, that is what Leave means, let's go for brexit
1/1	When I'm asked why I voted to #LeaveEU I think back to this in 2006 and the devastation of skilled workers who lost their jobs at a profitable plant.
1/1/1	When Ireland was compared to California I realised I made the right decision by voting Brexit.
0/0	When Putin and Trump are the only two looking forward to a Brexit its quite clear how bad a decision is.
0/0	When UK joined EEC in the 70s there were 3 main reasons listed in UK goverments White Paper: 1) EEC countries were growing faster than UK 2) UK‚Äôs role in the world had dimished and 3) the future is in Europe. UK was backrupt in the 60s and in the 70s IMF had to fund UK. In EU UK prospered. Forgot this ?
0/-1	When all countries are joining regional or global unity, why UK has the courage to face the coming difficult years alone?
1/1	When are the Tories going to stand up for the democratic will of 17.4 million BREXIT voters and give them the clean BREXIT they voted for?
0/0	When are you people going to realise that Nigel Farage is just a one-trick pony? Brexit..Brexit..Brexit..and then what? As soon as it's obtained, he'll walk away, and leave people directionless again. Brexit is not the end, it's only the beginning, and what use is another "Tory-lite" party, who won't give this country the change it so badly needs. At least UKIP have a plan for what happens "after" Brexit. Gerard Batten has actually done a great job of turning the party around, despite the MSM totally boycotting him from air-time.
0/0	When brexit becomes Regrexit
1/0	When global warming changes the gulf stream and the seas around Britain freeze over, rendering Britain even less climatically inhabitable than at present; or one of their nuclear power stations goes up in smoke because no-one knows how to use a screw driver any more; or a NATO war makes refugees of the Brits; it would be a good insurance to be allowed to move to more habitable parts of the EU.
0/0	When ignorant people vote, you get Trump and Brexit, both complete disasters.
0/0	When leave voters are sick of Brexit and struggle to give a reason why they voted the way they did, I think it‚Äôs time to stop this madness.
1/0	When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble ‚Äî our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.
0/-1	When someone refuses to be rational, what rational arguments can you use to change their mind?
1/1	When such so called important figures in our political hierarchy are clearly working against the voters' interests surely they must be removed. I refer specifically to Hammond and Bercow whilst the PM herself is no enthusiast for leaving, she at least is not working deliberately against it. Bercow and Hammond are and must be removed surely.
1/1	When that Sunderland vote came in, I jumped in the air. That's when Remain,EU arse lickers and the establishment knew they had lost
1/1	When that Sunderland vote came in, I jumped in the air. That's when Remain,EU arse lickers¬†and the establishment knew they had lost
1/-1	When the EU is doing well, Britain stays to make sure the Union does not progress more uniformly. When the EU begins to fall apart, i.e. it doesn't need Britain to tear it from within, Britain decides to leave
1/1	When the EU see that we are really leaving with a no-deal they will fold up like an old paper bag. And all those traitorous expats will lose their health cover and right of residence and have to sell their EU home at a big loss. Boo-hoo! Haha!
1/1	When the UK is finally free from the EU Extortionists, the UK can finally get down to business in growing the Economy, that will have monetary revenue now in UK Control that can now be used to uplift the Civil Service pay scale Sector.
1/1	When the UK joined the EU in 1973, we had 20% of the votes. Today we only have 9.5% of the votes.  #GoBrexit
0/1	When the UK voted to leave the EU, many feared a severe and immediate economic hit. The Bank of England suffered a loss of credibility for predicting a recession that never materialized (possibly because it‚Äôs own monetary policy actions stopped it). However, there has already been an economic cost to the vote.
1/0	When the euro tanks after the impending Italian default, we can pay the EU in broad beans
1/1	When the first major terror attacks hit Britain due to the fact terrorists can freely enter while pretending to be migrants, then people's opinions will change.
1/1	When the girl learned that I was pro-Brexit she considered it a personal betrayal
1/1	When the next Eurozone crisis occurs and Italy, amongst others requires a massive multi billion Euro bail out, Brexit will be viewed, as dodging a barrage of bullets.
1/1	When they can cheat knowing they‚Äôll only be fined pocket money if they get found out, this is not a functioning democracy. #Brexit #arronbanks
0/0	When we get our final say/2nd referendum vote, and we will, the debate is going to be fascinating. Are the Leavers going to base their argument on the parcel of lies they fed to us during the 2016 Referendum? Given that every one has been clearly and firmly nailed you would be forgiven for thinking they would be utterly stupid to do so. But what is their alternative? New lies? But what would they be based on since they pretty much covered all the issues with the first lot. Going to be very interesting.
1/1	When we leave the eu i will celebrate it as "independence day" where we get to take our country back!
1/1/-1	When will  we see the bonus for all and everyone of Brexit? Do we have to wait till march 2019 or do we get it before?
1/1	When will the USA be smart of this and get rid of all the illegal immigrants hear. All they do is trash everything like they did in their 3rd world countries & take the money that belongs to real US citizens. Everyone needs to go back to were they came from and fix their own countries.
0/-1	When will we stop killing trees to produce this crap?
1/1	When your government no longer represents the will of the people it's time to remove that government.
0/0	When you‚Äôve all lost your jobs and going to food banks maybe then, just maybe the message will get through how stupid this whole thing is.
1/1	Where are the videos on the benefits of leaving?
1/1	Where do I begin? For starters, the U.K. is a net financial contributor to the EU (despite the rebate) so we will be saving several billion pounds a year.
1/-1	Where do u keep all the blue peter badges uve earned
0/0	Where is the end? To stop this arrogance, admit the mistake and move to the best solution. What the UK needs least is another politician‚Äôs debate.
1/1	Where is the money coming from to rescue France and Italy, both on the edge of disaster, Germany will follow uk
1/-1	Whether we cancel Brexit, or not, we have to decide what kind of relationship we want with the EU.
0/0	Which clearly shows how there are NO economic advantages to leaving the EU. Brexiters promised better trade deals than the ones the UK is currently part of would be negotiated and ready to sign by the time of your departure. That never happened. Brexit is a SCAM. The only real reason for it was a handful of billionaires‚Äô TAX AVOIDANCE, and the only reason for millions of voters supporting was XENOPHOBIA.
0/0	While I agree with your sentiment that this is typical overreaction from the market, the real (negative) effects of the out campaign will creep in more slowly: a weaker Union, relative isolation from the economic power of the remainin EU, and the gradual realization by Out voters that their lives are not soon improving.
1/1	Whilst we may be down a little in the short term, i believe the strategic advantage of being out of the EU, particularly in terms of agility, will pay off in the long run.
1/1	Who actually cares about Immigration?! I don't like the fact that laws can be passed in Brussels and we have to implement them without a say. They also take plans and suggestions from large companies and lable them as new EU legislations. Things like building new roads as it will make it easier and cheaper for companies and heavy industry to traid so the CEOs bribe the EU into doing meaning its funded by the tax payers. Its so corrupt.
0/0	Who are now going to ruin the UK for ever.
0/0	Who are they going to blame once they're out of the EU or, and I am translating from Brexiteer English, once they've taken their country back?
1/1	Who cares about the price of my property dropping ? Who cares if some companies take their business elsewhere ? Who cares if we are seen as the black sheep ? I'll be fine with my blue passport.
1/1	Who cares what the EU agree - we're out of here.
1/1	Who cares what the Germans think. They are always happy to live under a dictatorship. Britain isn't.
1	Who cares? The EU is better without the UK.
1/1	Who do you think is going to pay for all those immigrants. Taxes will go up and the standard of living will decrease. And no more aid for the third world. Ha

1/1	Who in their right mind would want to stay in the EU after all of this! üòÇ
1/1	Who is actually interested in revenge apart from boneheads ? Actually sending them our mouthiest halfwit (that's you Farage) for their parliament seems to punish them enough.I would prefer a mutually beneficial relationship - and I am sure so would most in the EU27.

0/0	Who's going to do the low-wage jobs, in the absence of immigrants? No one, unless we abolish welfare, thereby giving our native-born scroungers two options, "Work, or die". The Old Labour types will rue the day they voted for Brexit.
1/1	Whoever it was made the mistake of assuming the EU would respect the UK contributions to the organisation over many years and treat the UK with some respect, unfortunately he/she misjudged the EU's morality.
0/0	Why Brexit, why...
1/1	Why I've voted #Brexit: for democracy, popular sovereignty, & a more open future.
0/0	Why are people against a united Europe anyway?
0/0	Why are people so surprised? Can anyone remember why the UK is actually  leaving? I've lost the plot now. I'm sorry I can't keep up.
1/1/1	Why are they asking an Irishman about Brexit.
1/1	Why are we not aloud to preserve our national identity, ¬†we just want our quiet way of life in our British community's and would just like to be left alone.
1/1	Why are you harping on about the Irish border on the no deal - who cares - put a border control up if need be jeez its not the biggest border in the world
0/1	Why blame the EU for British arrogance? Have these negotiations been carried out in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Greek? I doubt it. They have probably been carried out in English which is typical of the UK always wanting it their way....
0/1	Why can't parliament just accept that the deal from the EU is our only option. It might not be the best one (not my opinion), but we haven't got much choice anymore.
0/0	Why can't we just do the vote again? Most people regret choosing to leave anyways.
1/1	Why can‚Äôt these people accept democracy? If you like the EU so much, to and move to any EU country
1/0	Why do lefties never want to accept the will of the people?
0/0	Why do people think brexit means more trade with the rest of the world? This fallacy is equal to the ¬£350m for the nhs. Brexit equals lower bargaining power with the Chinese, Canadians, Indonesians etc.
0/1	Why do so much people act like England was never on its own ?
1/1	Why do some people are still daydreaming about remaining in the EU or a second referendum? They so have lost touch with reality. We're leaving the EU in March 2019. Period.
1/1	Why do the remoaners not realise the EU is broke why else are they determined to get our money ?
1/1	Why do these bias networks think anyone listen to them anymore, it's a winners brexit, not a remainer traitor losers, leave won and it will be done.
1/1/1	Why do they always consult pensioners or people with not much to say on Brexit. Interview me... I'm 34 and I have a lot to say about why we will be better off outside of the bloc.
1/1	Why do they keep coming up with stupid comments. Farms in England could provide if allowed.. people can grow their own like they did years ago
1/1	Why do they never talk about the good parts about leaving the EU? I like how everything tried to push England into voting in, but we were like no, let's just see what happens if we leave.
1/1	Why do vox look at this as a bad thing ,being in the EU made Britain not a democracy anymore which we fought world war for ,we weren't deciding our own laws and if we wanted the right as a country to change a law we had to go to Brussels to earn back which cost millions while doing so .Also we're not against all immigrants ,we don't mind the educated working ones ,it's the ones that are here illegally receiving child benefits and so on which we shouldn't have to pay to them but the EU says we must until just a few months ago when we had to fight for the right to make this our own decision  . So who in Britain benefits from the EU ? Well I'll give you a clue ,it's not the average middle class working majority of Britain but the mp's ,politicians and so on ,so if they have any say in this they will encourage people to stay as it benefits them . Learn your facts vox.
1/0	Why do we even bother to vote in this country?? I feel powerless and totally disillusioned now. Well, I guess it's just the way the worlds going; to shit.
1/1	Why do we pay our mp's for years it seems they have done nothing,cannot make decisions.Hide behind the EU, They gave the electorate the decision about leaving.We decided.Once we leave we will then sort you lot out.
0/0	Why do we want Brexit at all if we simply end up in a more unfavourable position?  We should revoke Article 50 whilst we can.
0/0	Why do you keep saying there are so many immigrants yet are overlooking fact that 2 million UK citizens moved to Spain since 1973?
1/1	Why do you need to governed by the French and Germans?¬† You are an Englishman.¬† Stand up.¬† Have some backbone.
1/1	Why do you think that they are making it so awkward for Britain to leave, they are panicking their best customers are going to buy elsewhere
0/1	Why does Britain like tea so much? Because tea leaves
1/1	Why does the UK have to give up on self-rule to do business with the rest of Europe?  The answer is, they don't.  The United States doesn't have to submit to a European Court, a European Parliament or any other Euro bureaucratic monster.  Free markets: Yes.  Loss of self-rule: NO.  It's quite simple really.
0/0	Why dont people understand that immigrants are a valuable work force? Lol
0/0	Why dont people understand that the uk isn't a big empire anymore
0/0	Why encourage the pointless and divisive ‚Äôbattle‚Äô between leavers and remainers, as if the referendum had not already happened ? As a ‚Äôremain‚Äô voter I realise that we have to make the best of it now, and support as ‚Äôsoft‚Äô a brexit as possible. A ‚ÄôPeople‚Äôs vote/final say‚Äô would leave us open to the risk of a ‚Äôhard‚Äô or ‚Äôno deal‚Äô brexit and therefore makes no sense at all.
1/1	Why have a second vote when the first one has not been implemented? The referendum vote was to leave the EU, no mention on the ballot paper of a deal, or transition period, neither was there any mention of giving away our fishing waters or offering huge amounts of money for a deal. all these things are designed to lock us into the EU by the back door by a bad prime minister.
1/1	Why in the hell would any British citizen want to join the undemocratic union of the EU! The EU union is a joke. Britain stay as a Sovereignty State.
0/1/1	Why is Brexit going to be bad for the UK ?, when we will get a good deal outside the EU, German business have put pressure on there government to strike a good deal with us because there bank forecasts if they don't it will hit there Economy by some 6 billion euros a year, and they will have to up there contributions to the EU with an overall annual combined cost of 11 billion euros thus they are urging there government to ensure a good deal, and this is just one voice of many in Europe pushing there leaders to ensure a good deal for the UK.
1/-1	Why is control immigration such a bad thing?
0/0	Why is leaving the EU seen as a must? Just because the vote won on leaving doesn‚Äôt mean the government has to leave especially since the vote were so close. In Sweden there has been multiple referendums where the public didn‚Äôt want something, but the government did it anyway.
1/1	Why is that guy spouting on about peace in Europe when he freely admits he doesn't know. What an idiot and there seems alot of remain people that have failed to educate themselves about what is really happening in Europe.

0/1	Why is this nonsense even being tolerated? We've known the EU wouldn't renegotiate for weeks. before the Brexit deal was defeated and before the pointless Brady amendment, and yet we're just sticking our fingers in our ears and carrying on as though we have never been told the bleedin' obvious. At this point, it is getting incredibly hard not to think the Government is just running down the clock to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.
1/1	Why is wrong that Britain wants their democracy back from faceless bureaucrats in Brussels
0/0	Why isn't the government listening to business people of this country, and stopping this ridiculous thing called Brexit.
0/0	Why not just stay in the EU...

0/0/0/0	Why people want to build borders, can't we just be friends

0/1	Why will anyone want to stay in the EU? - Do these people travel into Europe to see what is going on there? The UK do not need a deal. The EU NEEDS the UK. It is the EU that needs to be trying to make a deal with the UK. The UK simply needs to leave and take back control of its own destiny.

0	With Brexit, it's the same as separating life partners. Parents (EU and UK) go apart, and children (people) have to live with negative consequences. By separation everyone loses.
1/1	With Her Majesty the Queen's Birthday upon us, and St. George's Day within three days away, stand up all of you who love that land of Hope and Glory as I do a total stranger from a land where hatred for you is instilled from cradle to grave and beyond. ( I don't mean Australia ) Britons throughout the Centuries have stood as tall, straight, and fearless, as a Guardsman does when he is fighting for you, that is what's needed now to stop the Quislings from surrendering to a dictatorship that knows no bounds but the ones that tie Nations up in rules, and restraints, denying you the freedom to be your own Land of Hope ,and Glory. Vote to regain your soul, and sovereignty, by denying those who do not live in, nor love your Nation any say in what it means to be British so leaving you to be a sovereign Nation once again. God Save The Queen.
1/1	With all the new calls for more referendums around EU, we can hold that this was indeed the topple of the first domino. May the EUSSR's fall be swift, and permanent.
0/0	With critical levels of homelessness, an NHS crisis and so many other problems which need urgent attention, can we really afford to be wasting so much time and money on a Brexit which we can all see is falling apart?
0/0	With no trade deals in place and no one really needing anything you have I would say that the future for you post a no deal brexit is bleak. All your industry seems to be leaving ahead of brexit. Barclays, a bank no less, have move 190 billion in assets out of England into Ireland. You are dooming yourself, and for no good reason. This is not a gloat, I am genuinely worried about your economy and the livelihood of my British friends and family.

0/-1	With regard to #Brexit party loyalty is pretty much synonymous with betrayal of the country.
1/1	With ¬£39 Billion invested in to our own economy, instead of being frittered away to the Eu, its more likely that we will be rejoicing in the streets, ¬£39Billion will end Austerity and will save the NHS, with plenty left over.
0/0	Withdrawing Article 50 *is* the only sane thing to do. After that is done, those who peddled the Brexit lies should be brought to trial. The damage they have done to the country - and will do if they are allowed to go any further with this madness - is almost incalculable.
0/1	Without the EU maybe there's an end to blaming the EU for everything. Maybe the people wake up and take a closer look at what their government is actually doing (or not doing).
0/0	Without the EU protecting us we will have less freedom, the extreme right wingers in British politics will see to that.

0/0	Wow, Brexiter is openly blatantly lying and misleading about the EU. It is basically warmongering and nobody is calling her out. No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave. Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.
0/0	Wow, I didn't know much about Brexit before watching this. The UKIP's views on immigration and foreigners are horrifyingly similar to the Trump administration's. I really hope this isn't becoming a global trend.
0/0	Wow, just wow. Brexit is like some sort of crazy vortex that makes even the most accomplished and honest journalists write absolute, bad-faith horseshit
1/1	Wow, what a completely one sided view of Leave voters. Come and ask me why I voted leave. Immigration was bottom of my list of reasons, I'm more concerned with unelected officials in the EU Commission being the only people who can propose legislation which affects all of us. I want our laws and politicians answerable to the electorate of this country, not being dictated by corrupt old Nazi sympathisers in Brussels.
1/1	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad
1/1	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad. Methinks they doth protest too much.
1/-1	Wow...so Europeans are just as ignorant as Americans....but then again they were lied to over and over again.
1/1	Wrong .They wont be forgiven for not having a proper Brexit.
1/1	Wrong again matey, the only reason the EU is sitting back and waiting is because they know the snowflake MPs we have will secure a deal for them. If the UK had gone for no deal from the start, we would be out long ago, and the EU would have been knocking on the UKs door for a deal, get your facts right.
1/1	Wto requires border checks/ controls because its dealing with tariffs etc. Stop flogging the lie that it doesn't. Stop flogging the lie that the uk as a signatory to the GFA will not be responsible for breaking that agreement. Basically stop flogging lies. Tell your truth which is I don't give a damn about the GFA & I want out on March 29..end of, no need for justification, just out.
0/0	Xenophobia is the main cause of Brexit.
0/0	YAY! Brexit FAIL!!!
1/1	YES! That‚Äôs what I voted for! They need us more than we need them!
1/1	YOU ONLY MENTIONED OTHER WHITE CHRISTIAN EUROPEAN MIGRANTS AND NOT THE FEW MILLION MUSLIM MIGRANTS THAT ARE A HUGE PROBLEM. THE PEOPLE FROM POLAND WANT TO INTEGRATE INTO BRITISH SOCIETY AND WORK HARD. MUSLIMS HAVE ZERO INTENTION OF DOING THIS. THEY COME TO GET WELFARE AND AS MUCH FREE STUFF AS THEY CAN FOR THEIR SEVERAL WIVES AND MANY CHILDREN. THEY HATE ALL NON MUSLIMS AND WANT TO CONQUER ALL NATIONS. THEY WANT THE COUNTRIES THEY THEY HAVE MIGRATED TO ,TO COMPLY TO THEM.BRITAIN IS SMART TO GET OUT OF THE EU
1/1	YOU can all leave the UK and live in Europe if you like. The rest of us don‚Äôt mind.
0/0	Ya'll fucked up and are trying to figure out how to un fuck up without admitting you fucked up.
0/0	Ya, Brits are really stupid.
1/0	Yea, the EU was designed by the 'Nazis' in 1942 under the ideas of the jew/asian Kalergy in order to bring multiculturalism and non-white immigrants into in Europe for
0/0	Yeah Brexit is the baddest, most selfish, loonatic thing that will happen to England in my generation, I don't want to spend an hour in customs, to be able to travel where I want I don't want chicken from US and many more things. BREXIT WILL RUIN MY GENERATIONS FUTURE! I can't believe how ppl can be so selfish to only think about themselves.
0/0	Yeah sure... the Pound Sterling dropped 20%... racists are attacking immigrants now.... wonderful Great Britain !!  Good luck !!  You idiots !!  .... Glad you're an island !!!  Only thing we need to to is flood the tunnel ......
0/0	Yeah! Who needs money and jobs? We'll survive by gnawing on our stiff upper lips and drinking our own arrogance. If you want out, GET OUT. Maybe you should have done it before you had a kid, you fucking cockroach.
1/1	Yeah, Hard Brexit is the best way!
0/0	Yeah, but blue passports. #worthIt. I'm joking. Crying inside.
0/0	Yeah, but remember that the idiots who support Brexit will then blame the EU because they aren't getting all the benefits with none of the effort...stupid will always be stupid
0/0	Yeah, don't worry, nothing will happen because of Brexit. It's just all a big show.¬†Right.
0/0	Yeah, it would be stupid for the UK to leave the EU...
0/0	Yeah, let‚Äôs go back to 1973, now who wants 3 day weeks, power cuts and 11.5% interest rates on their mortgage and bank rates of 8%.......don‚Äôt all rush to get some. Older people will remember this so voting to go back to it surprises me somewhat.
1/1	Years of debates over nothing! People voted out and this politicians have no right to stop the democratic will of the people and must get on with the exit! ‚úå
0/0	Yeh! The only good Brexit is No Brexit. End of.
0/0	Yep its horriffic (I'm a Brit in the UK). Once the reality kicks in (after we leave) its going to get much, much worse. But of course its undemocratic and treasonous to have that point of view.
1/1	Yep we don't need the EU and its corrupt un elected Twonks. I'm voting OUT!
1/1	Yep, Aussie here. Our useless pollies are negotiating new trade deals already. Anything to kick the Europhiles in the nuts.
0/0	Yep. That people see brexit as some prize in itself...it just boils my piss. They're not even being selfish and seeking to profit at others expense. Its just pure spite. They know others are suffering more so they enjoy it.
0/0	Yep. The EU is blamed for our own failings.
1/0	Yep. The only reason people would want their sovereignty back is racisim. For sure.
1/0	Yes Britain voted to leave, and yes  the EU seems to have lost the UK. Although the EU is a bit like Hotel California, you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.
0/0	Yes EU will survive and reform of course, but UK will be left behind.
1/1	Yes I agree, Brexit is terrible. I don't want to live in a free, independent democracy, it's far too difficult. I'm confused, insecure and unhappy. I wish I had some unelected bloke from Belgium or Luxembourg to tell me what to do . . . .
1/1	Yes I stand, no regrets.
0/0	Yes I think Britain benefits a lot, financially, from being in the EU. I don't think there is anyone who thinks Brexit will make Britain richer.
0/0	Yes and 27 prime ministers will kneel and give everything so they can support UK, wake up man
0/0	Yes but it won't be the UK, it will just be England. Wales and Northern Ireland can secede too, as can Yorkshire, Isle of Man, Channel Islands. It won't be the 5th largest economy if it starts breaking up will it? It will get relegated down quite quickly and our huge debt mountain will quite quickly become unsustainable.too. So we may be independent and stop all the immigrants coming but we'll have kicked our economy in the goolies.
0/0	Yes free from any hope of economic growth and prosperity. VOTE IN
1/1	Yes there is a bit of uncertainty in leaving, but what is certain is if we stay in this country is finished, my grand children would be in constant threat from the increase of imigration
1/1	Yes yes yes at last. The EU want our money and they want to shaft us at the same time and make it as awkward as possible. Time to tell them that no deal equals no money. This should have been our stance from the start!
1/-1	Yes, EU migrants have much easier life than non EU in entering the UK and this is not fair. There are two ways to fix the fairness issue though, why do we only consider one?
0/0	Yes, but nobody said that you can't. What you can't do is to negotiate as a big block with others, when you are not part of that block
1/1	Yes, everything is ok. Liam Fox says no-deal brexit is survivable
0/0	Yes, it's how I feel too, but we must put our energies into fighting brexit in every way we can!
1/0	Yes, let's tell the stupid people that they voted wrong, says the elite and make a movie. Who has sponsored this crap? Yes, EU.
0/-1	Yes, look at all the other countries lining up to hand in their resignations... oh wait, there aren't any, because they're not dumb or arrogant enough to believe they can punch above their weight on their own.
0/0	Yes, the EU must be quaking with fear with the UK saying give us what we want or we'll shoot ourselves in the head.
0/0	Yes, this article goes a long way to explain what happened in 2016. I live in an area of north west England which voted Remain as we‚Äôve benefitted enormously from EU investment.
0/0	Yes, we do indeed buy produce from countries with whom we do not have trade deals. But wait until the pound takes a further hammering, and our EU sourced food becomes more expensive. Prices will rise and standards will fall. And if we waiver import tariffs, it will decimate British agriculture.
0	Yes, we lost the 2016 vote, but we're not getting over it; the result was both flawed & wrong, so we fight on to #StopBrexit
1/1	Yes, we should go the way of big business and heavy bureaucracy and remain in Europe so that we lose more and more power until German bureaucrats decides all for us!   But wait... neither Norway nor Switzerland are EU members yet they have free borders and allow people of Europe to work freely. How does that work and why can't Britain have that too?
0	Yes, yes, you are not suggesting a u-turn because you belatedly realise Brexit was the stupidest idea in human history. It‚Äôs to sabotage the EU [wink] [wink]
0/0	Yes, you don't like Immigrants and students from other countries. That is OK, to be a isolated and uncooperative empire.
0/0	Yes. I'm disgusted by the whole thing. I genuinely can't believe we are here, in this shit situation, waiting for the shit to hit the fan. You know what? Part of me really hopes it's as bad as I expect it will be, just to sicken the fucking bastards who voted for it.
0/1	Yes. You want out, so get out.
0/0	Yes. You're right. To see the world move away from globalisation, from progress, really would be amazing. . . amazingly stupid. Your entire desire for this is 'wah wah in my opinion the evil leftist liberals ALWAYS WIN waaaaah.'  You don't actually give a fuck about England or understand it at all. The 'England' (you've never even visited, really?) that you love exists because of the EU, not in spite of. Sure, the history is cool, the land is beautiful, but a country is only as great as its people, and England's people come from all over. The English people believe in a socialist democracy, in sharing resources and giving newcomers a helping hand, knowing that those newcomers' children and children's children will be the doctors and lawyers and friends of your children and your children's children.  You are a selfish, single-minded person who wants a personal victory and doesn't give a shit about the state of the U.K., and England, whatever you happen to think England is.
0/0	Yest it's Racist. Stop Brexit
1/1	Yet again Britain fighting for freedom from Germany and their empire building, same old same old, we'll be liberating France and Europe again before long
0/0	Yet brexshitters still bray the EU is corrupt!!!!!
1/1	Yet, somehow, Switzerland has all the trading benefits and none of the negatives.
1/1	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU
1/1	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU.
1/1	You Scots reading this, if there is no democracy, there is no INDEPENDENCE. The EU does not Do either.
1/1	You act like Britain is in a begging position when it comes to brexit when in fact it is the complete opposite seeing how Britain is Europe's fastest growing economy and is the top destination for many of Europe's manufactured products.
0/0	You are going to have more immigration either way. What's more, the immigration from EU almost negative at this point. Even Polish people are going home, since they can get better jobs with higher wages in Poland than in UK... This whole thing with immigartion is asinine, it really is. EU doesn't cause your immigration problem and if anything, it could be part of solution (for whole europe)
1/1	You are ignorant of the facts. Brexit is about a struggle for democracy. It's a resounding refusal to accept unelected undemocratic rule from a group of self-serving politicians who took office via backroom deals. Brexiteers couldn't be more un-Trump like.
0/0	You are now born a prisoner on the island... but what was your crime ?
1/1	You are right Europe just doesn't understand us and never has. We're a global nation not a European one. If we have to choose between Europe and the Atlantic we'll choose the Atlantic every time! üá¨üáß
1/0	You assume of course the commonwealth countries want a strong union with the UK.
0/0	You brextremists shame my country.
1/1	You can have extra time to do the paperwork on an agreed, and passed, deal - but you may not delay the actual decision to leave the EU, deal or no deal...
0/1	You can't eat your cake and have it. BREXIT is Exit.
1/1	You can't put a price on sovereignty.
0/0	You can‚Äôt insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore
1/0	You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. "Research the facts" - did you get yours from the Daily Mail? If you think that the majority of world-leading economists and business leaders who have been at the forefront of their respective field for years and agree that we will be poorer outside the EU are wrong and you with your one hour of research are right you are completely deluded and clearly extremely egoistic.
0/0	You don't get even close to the same rights as other EU citizens unfortunately. Reminder that the leave campaign repeatedly. And explicitly promised that nobody would lose a single right from brexit.
1/1	You don't have to be a member of the EU to trade with it
0/0	You done goofed up Britain
0/0	You don‚Äôt fool anyone @BorisJohnson sounding all reasonable when you‚Äôre running down the clock to a #NoDeal disastrous #Brexit
0/1	You don‚Äôt need a piece of paper with numbers on it to have an economic assessment
1/0	You don‚Äôt need to be an EU member.. just look at Norway Iceland and Switzerland =)
0/0	You guys (UK) should head west or the Atlantic you are not Europe! Also you Scotland probably can‚Äôt be independent you probably won‚Äôt be able to join the eu and you‚Äôll struggle ALOT to find good trade deals leaving you in some money problems. If your Scottish or from the UK no offence
0/0	You guys seem to be forgetting or deliberately ignoring the level of EU spending in the UK. It's not just about money though, it's about mutual co-operation and being part of a bloc that's big enough and strong enough to positively influence World events. Maybe you think England , Wales & NI can do that alone ? ( make no mistake , leaving the EU will lead to Scotland leaving the UK) . We could and should lead Europe and that way we shape things. The grass just isn't greener out of the EU!
1/1	You have NO idea of the anger revoking Article 50 would cause. Just get on with #Brexit.... which is what we voted forüëç
1/1	You have not idea what poverty is. UK have it really good, even with no deal UK will still OK. you panic but reality is money talks. everything will be chaotic  for few months but the dust will set and we will be fine try to support British products and employ British citizen this will help your own house.
0/0	You have to admit, this Brexit thing is turning out pretty crap. It's nothing like you imagined is it? And there aren't really any EU laws that you don't like and those laws were made with UK input for the past 40 years anyway....unlike WTO rules. I mean, you don't really want hormone saturated beef or things like regulations removed so that unscrupulous traders can cut up baby formula with sawdust and stuff like that anyway.
1/1	You join the EU and you loose control over your own country.
0/1	You know things are bad when you move past anger to grief and you can feel despair knocking at the door!! If England will not reject this deal and go for a hard exit I just don‚Äôt know if England will survive.
1/1	You know what Britain thinks, we told you on the 23rd June 2016, and seemingly repeat it every day, and every time you push the idea of not bothering after all. We want OUT. Out means Out, not if's no buts, no cherries, no deals, just out.
0/0	You know what the worst thing is... a LOT of people who voted leave changed their mind after the results were in, they claim they didn't realise that it would be so close and that their vote would count!
1/1	You know what... We were in two world wars... at the end of each one life was grim, housing shortages, food shortages, poverty, unemployment. But..... the people of Great Britain pulled TOGETHER and got through it and life got infinitely better. So then people, aren't we supposed to learn from history? History tells us pull TOGETHER and all will come out ok. Valuable lesson! Put your differences aside, stop behaving like squabbling children and support each other and your country. And may I suggest that if you don't want to do that there's still the option to move to the great EU that you're so fond of
1/1	You know. There were a couple good reasons not to leave that you made, but the rest of this video was bizarrely off-point. Are you telling me that the citizens of the UK shouldn't consider what they want in this vote, that they should only listen to what the USA, China, and other nations tell them to do? And of course the EU would be against the UK leaving the EU, because the UK is one of the only two economically strong member nations it has, the other being Germany. Let's also ignore that you're suggesting that 190 million pounds (10 BILLION per year) is somehow a negligible amount of money to pay to nations that can't support themselves, because it's not the 350 that the man quotes! You said a lot of bullshit in this video, a lot more than usual, and it's sad to see you gloss over it all as unimportant, whenever you would absolutely harp on these points if it were an opponent of yours making them.
1/1	You may think it's better when we work closer together. Personally I am fed up of Britains citizens constantly being dumped on or have to pay for every mistake our "Europe" partners make. Sick of bailing other people out. We must leave, vote out on 23rd June!!!!
1/1	You mean how the EU lost Britain..well done to the 17.4 million Brits who voted out and who believe in self determination, self governance, independence and democracy..Hopefully it will be the beginning of the end of this failed European Union that has done so much damage to Europe..God bless Great Britain from the George Cross island of Malta
0/-1	You mean the EU. U.k will always be part of Europe. All those years the gov told us not to trust Communism. Now that's what they want.
1/1	You must despise democracy we already had one and we voted to leave EU dictatorship
0/0	You old fools. The rich will now gewt even richer. Exit will not solve your propblems.
0/0	You overlook the point that a successful Brexit was never possible and this should have been explained before the referendum.
1/1	You ran the worlds biggest empire ... and now you are scared of leaving the EU
1/0	You really are ridiculous, look at youth unemployment figures in other EU countries, look at the Lisbon treaty, look at verhofstadt speeches, work it all out and then tell me you think by leaving you're taking away young people's futures.NO FOR BREXIT
0/0	You really kicked yourself in the teeth with this Brexit thing.
0/0	You said it buster, just delay it long enough for the old and demented to give up the ghost and let the young people take us back in.
1/1	You said that the end that most people want to remain  the ones who voted leave but I vote leave and I would vote leave again and again and again
0/0	You see? The problem¬†in the UK¬†is education: they don‚Äôt even teach you elementary punctuation rules‚Ä¶
1/0	You seem to want to be both out of the EU and in the EU at the same time. The head of the EU has said Britain needs to start the process of leaving now rather than later. The referendum was advisory? You mean the government can choose to ignore it? I don't think so. There are only a few thousand migrants in Calais? It's nice that you don't mind if they enter the U.K. I thought most voters who voted "out" did so to keep the migrants out, not to increase the amount that can get in. At least you admit people thought there were a lot more migrants trying to get in than there really were.
0/0	You stop paying your dues, but expect to continue to use the facilities for free.
1/0	You talk about the West, what West? Why not publish Michael Goves political indictment of this so called West. The West I know is the one in which the political franchise is in the hands of the people and not exercised by 33,000 unelected bureaucrats on a daily basis
0/0	You think #Remain is big? #Rejoin will be f*cking MASSIVE... because it will include ever-increasing numbers of former Leavers when they finally realise they were lied to.
0/0	You think it's bad now , wait until we actually leave! It's gonna be a bumpy ride
1/1	You very deluded young lady if you think the EU is better you obviously don't love the UK that much bye bye sees you
0/0	You voted in favour of it, now you all have to pay the price for your poor choices.
0/0	You wait and see who's life expectancy fall if brexit goes through and it will be down to all the stupid bastards who voted to leave. Oh yes, and you.
0/-1	You were naive, as was anybody who thought an in/out referendum on the biggest political decision in our country's history was a good idea in any way, shape or form.
1/1	You will go bankrupt without the UK. Go recognise!
0/1	You will see that, at best, we are going to get a soft brexit where we pay through our nose, lose all our influence and become the laughing stock of Europe.
0/0	You're all idiots! Being in the EU was better for us
0/0/0/0	You're right, people should unite, not devide
1/1	You've been hearing about Brexit for 3 years. And it's still going. Wasn't there already a vote? Where does it stand and what comes next? What's a Hard Brexit? A 'no-deal' Brexit? What is the Irish backstop? If you don‚Äôt understand Brexit, here‚Äôs your chance to catch up.
0/0	You've been living in the wrong EU. You've inhabited the EU of the foetid mind of English Europhobes who consistently and resolutely refuse to open their eyes to the reality of the European Union. It's a pity because this blindness has wrecked Britain.
0/0	You've had 2 years to deliver "your brexit". You have failed to do so. Now it's time for people to decide whether or not to continue with this madness. No election - a second referendum. Then an election so that Corbyn can lead us into a new era of peace, prosperity and partnership with our European friends.
1/1	You've had over two years! All extra time does is play into the EU's hands. That is what they want - to delay, delay, delay. We voted to leave, deal or no deal.
0/0	Young people understand the impact of Brexit better.... #antibrexit
1/1	Youngsters will be called up to the new EU army. We're getting EU tax codes. Cameron has signed fast track for Turkey and Merkel gives them visa free travel. EU Commissioners says they're taking over all health services, so end of our NHS. We are subsidising bankrupt countries, high unemployment, uncontrolled migration, terrorism. The EU bank is in meltdown printing money like confetti. The EU project has failed and heading for extinction. We are Great Britain and can stand on our own feet. Love your kids future. Love Britain. VOTE LEAVE!
0/0	Your faith in Brexit working out would be touching if it wasn¬øt based on stupidity and ignorance! Only when the pain of Brexit hits will you understand the scale of your idiocy! Even then you¬øll probably have delusions about reliving World War 2. Oooooo rationing!
1/1	Your having a laugh,the Eu will never change,the French and Germans will see to that,it suits them how it is.
1/1	Your map shows that Switzerland, a central European country, is NOT a member of the EU. It never has been. And are the Swiss people living in poverty, unable to trade with the countries around them ? Of course not. In fact Switzerland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world. So much for the NEED for a nation to be in the EU ...
1/1	Your mission next #Thursday is quite simple. #Vote for #democracy, vote for #sovereignty, #voteLeave! #BBC #SKY #ITV
0/0	Your question implies there was a point where it was a good idea...  I have been strongly remain since the start.
0/-1	Youth turnout was 40% while the national average was 70. As usual, the younger voters didn't bother showing up. The under 25s have no one but themselves to blame. The more politically engaged generation won the day.
0/-1	You‚Äôre kidding right ? Did you not take any finance classes while earning you‚Äôre MBA !? Sovereignty for sovereignty sake is NOT a solution! This is emotional short-term thinking.
1/1	You‚Äôve had long enough and nothing will change the hard decision that has to be made. Get on with it. Out 29/3/19.
0/1	Yup Brexit was a great idea, thanks guys who fucked over our country I mean voted leave.
1/1	Yup get us out of this Union!
1	Yup. Do not believe the leftists lies and Brussels.
1/1/1	a 'coup' is an illegal take overBrexit was not. Although since then, we have been betrayed by the government...
0	a dark cloud has descended onto me and I swear the gloom is directly related to how I feel about Brexit, the increasing hatred seen on our streets and the direction the country is going in
0/0	a stupid decision, made by stupid people, who had no idea what they were voting for
1/1	a) Thanks for asking for rational debate - I just got told I was being 'offensive' on r/unitedkingdom for wishing people 'were less explosive' and would actually engage with the debate rather than resorting to abusive rhetoric on both sides. (You can probably tell that rubbed me up the wrong way)  b) The UK is the fifth strongest economy in the world - something pro-EU campaigners always pass over when saying leaving would destroy us economically. The EU can't feasibly halt all trade with the UK because that is not really how it works, and many many countries not in politically unified blocks survive economically. All the arguments have been made by other comments so check those out.  c) My main reason in sovereignty. I dislike the necessity of only really expressing my democratic right by electing representatives because we only actually have vague guarantees on how they will conduct their role as a representative and their decisions are more about their views than it is about ours. With that in mind, the idea that MEPs can elect someone on my behalf is ridiculous because in reality I have absolutely no say. If only a huge minority of the population has any say in such elections, that is not democracy.  d) I don't deny there won't be a negative consequence over leaving the EU, it is a very real possibility, mainly because uncertainty makes people nervous. In fact that seems to be the main point that pro-EU arguments make. BUT that doesn't mean leaving isnt the right decision. The unelected leaders of the EU/European Commission have said too much nervewracking things about undermining the sovereignty of members states (including removing the UK's seats on the UN, G7 ect in favour of integrating them into EU seats which gives us far less say in world affairs) to make me happy to remain in the EU. Fear of short term disruption, which will occur after any big change is not a satisfactory argument against long term change for the better, because that would mean we could never and would never change anything, and are slaves to the status quo and may as well not have democracy because making decisions is on the whole a bad idea.
0/0	all that austerity for nothing and the brexitanian cult is still desperate for its apocalypse
0/0	all this because white people would rather destroy their own nations than live next to people of color. Same thing happening in the United states
0/-1	all those regulations are there for a reason just like the US has a lot of regulations. And the UK were a part when deciding these laws. and if there was somethijng the didn't liked the could use a VETO what they also sometimes did (prove that they can VETO). Many are forgotten that the brexit vote came from Cameron who just wanted more EU laws in the UK's favour but he didn't want to exit and now look.
0/1	alot of the reasons people voted to leave were reasons of passion. Not economical reasons entirely that can be simply explained.
1/1	already done people voted together out f EU dictatorship
0/0	already gone and never going back, the wonderful world of the EU countries has a level of peace happiness prosperity and civilisation that sadly the UK will never have again in my lifetime
1/1	am English & voted with many of my friends family & people from the same street to LEAVE the EU. We simply do not think it is a good idea to be ruled by a foreign power that does not have our best interests in mind & would like to control our borders. This is a very small country that is nearly full. This man is a liar & a fool. We are not racists - in fact as a country we are remarkably tolerant. We realised that to leave may make us poorer but felt that this was a cost worth paying.
1/1	am from London and i dont think people in the North of England are racist all of us that voted to leave done the right thing. because if we didn vote leave imagine how overpopulated an unrecognisable this country will be in maybe 20 30 40 or 50 years if we stay in the E.U this country will not look likr England no more and it will never be again
0/0	an people in their 60s stop saying We'll just take the hit" on Brexit. YOU WON'T BE THE ONES TAKING THE HIT. Your careers are either already established or finished. Some of us are are trying to get started. Some of us will have to support families in Brexit economy!"
0/0	and higher prices, int'l marginalisation, recession... Whoops!
1/1	and you wont get our money , then watch your glorious united states of europe fall apart , under monetary pressure . prick .
0/0	and, as per usual, Conservatives can break anything, but have absolutely no idea how to fix anything...
0/0	anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it‚Äôs wrong.¬† Stop Brexit
1/1	as a British person watching this video, it's very biased against the Brexit position. Brexit is about Democracy and support for Brexit is as Strong as ever.

0/0	he problem with decades like this and this video kind of highlights it. Is that it's not an equal argument. There are way more reasons to stay inside the EU than leaving
0/0/0	hilarious video but Brexit remains a tragedy regardless. Not for the EU, not for the UK (perhaps), but for those who believed that united we are better off.
1/1	how far the British empire has fallen in the EU. this could be the step we need to get control over our country again. it wont be easy and there will be cuts but i think leaving the EU will help get the UK under control again

0/0	i can see how in 20 years england will blame EU for their economical situation, "they boycotted our economy because we dared to free ourselves from them"  it is never going to be their fault,we will become the monsters in their mythology...  -_-  the EU is not going to make you suffer for leaving,that will just be the effect of losing privileges
1/1	i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.

0/0	i voted leave just because i thought it the right thing to do, i thought it will help our country somehow but now i just want Brexit to be gone we are destroying our economy it crazy.
0/0	i voted remain , not that it really matters now, the EU in some form or another will continue, no one wants fines, trade embargoes, sanctions and challanges in trade between the UK and the EU
1/1	i voted to leave because; when we had our mp expenses scandal one mp said"thinkyourself lucky your not bliving in europe its a hundred times worse there, recently a study on corruption within the eu claim 144 billion gone in corruption with a total cost of 800 billion, i didnt want to pay for our own corruption let alone the likes of bulgaria,croatia, greece and italy
0/0	i'm american, but from an outside standpoint, i like the eu. it just seems like a good idea-the countries are stronger together, and it means that the only wars in europe are from other continents. in fact, i think we should have something like that with canada and mexico! it would probably help to solve a lot of economic problems, especially in mexico, it would fix the illegal immigration issue, and it would ensure that the hostility trump sparked with mexico didn't turn into actual fighting.
0/-1	i'm glad I left little Britain to live in the Netherlands...A the people are so polite here and B the country is a damn sight lot cleaner too
0/0	i've got a solution for this mess: i think May should ask the EU to reopen negotiations.
0/-1	id prefer it if the vote was based on fact, reason and logic. Not lies and hatred.
1/1	if brexit vote by the public does not count then each time people vote for a new government then that vote does not count so let's just have a dictatorship
1/1	if everyone wants to know why Britain left the EU watch the movie that was made about which you can find free of charge on youtube.  the name of the movie is Brexit.  it is very informative and explains everything for Britain's perspective.
1/1	if it wasnt for Britain you would be writing this in German and not Spanish! ..... good luck fishing and enjoy your precious EU toilet hole.... your welcome to it!
1/1	if the Lisbon treaty isn't a good enough reason for us to leave the eu then i don't know what is
0/0	if the UK leaves the EU, its gonna be a disaster for the British citizens, Economic crisis for the whole Uk
1/1	if the votr was tomorrow i would vote to leave, we are strong enough, and why shoukd we let brussels tell us what to do , thats why we fought 2 world wars, to stay a free nation , to control our own destiny, and our own borders, VOTE YES i will.

1/1	ill never taste of piece of bacon that tasted as good as this result.
0/1	im a leftist and i think we should leave
0/-1	immigration, the area over which many Eurosceptics most long for control.Exactly, by leaving the EU, Britain can stop the migrants
1/1	in France a lot of French people admire the choice that anglettere made with brexit.
1/1	in the EU we might be able to..., we could perhaps..., it may be possible to... Rubbish!  It has never been possible - they only want our money, not our naturally conservative outlook.  The show is run by Germany and to a lesser extent France and that is it. The EU is drivng away from what was a sensible economic co-operation model - the free market we voted to join, into a political project whose ultimate goal will be a federal EU, where member state parliaments are redundant and all decisions are made by people who are unaccountable. If we are forceed by the Remainers to stay in, it will be the Euro next and  the EU Army, then taxes, the whole process will be accelerated as the EU hierarchy will feel they have an open door to do what they like. A significant reason why many voted Brexit in the UK was I'm sure to retain our fundamental rights of self-detemrination/sovereignty. And if the peoples of EU member states were allowed to vote, I have no doubt many of the nation states would vote the same way.  France included.
1/1	in the end the majority voted to leave, so I think we should leave.
0/0	independence day for britain from what from them applying for EU membership and then retreating they are such a joke
1/1	independence from germans colonization
0/0/0	is my message to britan you are one of our most powerful members but if you leave we will maybe become much more powerless and maybe disolve so if you stay the eu will be more powerful so please stay
1/1	isn't EU part of the UN , globalist control ???? I think UK should be independent , as before ,
0/0	it is good to have Britain in the EU to counterbalance Germany and France. Besides it will cost my country a lot of money and economic damage when Britain leaves.
0/-1	it is invalid . period .
0/0	it is not EU going down idiot , it is UK ..u must be blind not to see it
0/0	it leads to mass unemployment.
1/1	it means more patriotism, it means steps away from a dangerous NWO and the Bilderberg group. It means less rape in Britain. Nothing is going to happen to the EU migrants anyway.
0/0	it sounds very stupid to leave the eu
1/1	it was the best idea ever, Britain has never been as united as now.
0/-1	it would be an absolute disaster
1/1	it would be difficult to consider Britain a democracy if the free and valid Brexit election was ignored or overturned. that's banana republic stuff.
1/1	it's a clear choice between the short term economy and self-rule with belief in self-potential.
1/1	it's about time the UK gets there independence
0/0	it's an absolute shit show and we're looking like mugs! Very embarrassing
0/0	it's an absolute shit show and we're looking like mugs! Very embarrassing!
1/1	it's better than loosing our democracy to the EU
0	it's not democracy when the majority of people that voted don't understand what they voted for.
1/1	it's not nationalism, fascism, racism or isolationism! It's democracy. The majority of British people voted to leave the European Union and their voices will be respected.
1	it's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship !
1/0/1/1	it's such a beautiful thing seeing the UK do what is right. they at least give their country a chance
1/-1	italy will follow UK soon !

0/0	keep up the good work. Brexit must be stopped. We here in main land EU despair at the failing UK politicians
1/1	last week I was shopping and I saw a guy walking around with a blue jumper with yellow stars on it. I approached him and asked if he was British? and he said 'yes'. I said 'why are you wearing that shit EU flag? If you want to wear a jumper why not wear a Union Jack one? Don't you support your country'? I took my coat off and dropped it on the floor along with my shopping bags. He took his jumper off and said he was sorry. I think he realised he was 30 seconds away from getting his lights knocked out. As he walked away, I heard his wife say to him 'See, I told you not to wear that stupid thing'.
1/1	leave it Britain! The EU is far corrupted like every other countries in this world
1/1	leave means leave
1/1	leave now, EU is a mess
1/1	leave won the referendum, with the biggest turnout of people old enough  by uk law to vote ever in our history of voting , and i expect the government to deliver a complete break with the e.u! not the fake remainiacs brexit that they say is a good deal for us!!, i think its time to replace may with someone who will deliver a real brexit or face the onslaught at the next general election from 17.3 million or more now angry voters!! who knows maybe a new party will emerge soon who will deliver real brexit! the country is crying out for a third party who believe in real brexit as we will never get it from labour, conservative or liberal!!. the batman.

0/1	leaving for me simply is not worth the risk.
1/1	leaving the EU will be one of the best things ever to happen to this country. it wont be long before others follow when the block begins to collapes the cracks are already showing.
0/0	leaving the single most important union when it comes to peace and prosperity in Europe and not being very sure about each detail before doing it seems quite a temper tantrum.
0/0	let britain leave with no deal, they need it to undertand what it means !
0/1	lets start with the fact that the uk is using eu nationals as bargaining chips and fucks with their future and peace of mind.

0/-1	most effective quote I've seen is, get ready to swap out white immigrants for brown immigrants
0/0	most inmigrants to UK are from Commomwealth of nations, not from middle east syrians. If European immigration policies are issued on Islamization of Britain it is a mistake, al Pakistan inmigrants to uk arrived thanks to Commonwealth not to EU.
1/1/1	most of the other EU countries apart from UK don't even follow the rules and regulations of the EU anyway, even more reason to leave when we are getting so spanked by rules and regs that others don't even follow
0/0	most of the ppl that voted "Leave" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision
1/1	most of us just want Brexit to be implemented and to get it done, and try our best to make it a success.

1/-1	muh sovereignty
1/1	my biggest problem with the eu is that its increasingly becoming more of a superstate backed by elitists such as the rothchilds and soros just take a look at the eu army take a look at all the times we tried to block a deal and failed to do so
1/1	my elders told me they voted in to the EU. these are the same people who voted out in the masses just many years later. millennials blame the elders, but yet these elders are the ones with the best reason to do so for living through it
0/0	my main problem is I don't trust the government. the eu helps take some power away from them, keeps the European human rights courts for us to go to and provides your average citizen with some recourse.  we won't hate that without the eu.  do you trust the government enough? I mean right now we had an education minister who didn't listen to headteachers, an environment minister who doesn't believe in climate change this isn't exactly a trust worthy government and i doubt those that follow will be much better.
0/0	my problem is I have no faith in my compatriots to be willing to listen to long version of what the issues are
1/0	next 15 years, 90% of world demand will be generated outside Europe. Yet the EU does not have free trade
0/0	nice move uk, you played yourself. now we sit back and watch their economy fall

0/0	no it isn't. Brexshit is like the sense of freedom you get absailing for the fist time without the support of a rope. For some reason I have never met anyone keen to try it twice...
1/1	no more illegal EU backed  regime change that resulted in the migrant crises. People died and lost their homes. Now UK will not participate in war crimes. Mass migration will not be necessary as people will have their homes.
1/1	no one is worthy of leading all so no one should lead all. the brexit is progress for humanity. the eu is progress for certain segments of society. I choose humanity over society, you can keep your economic lies.
1/1	no pain no gain
0/0	no respect any more for the uk none whatsoever!
0/0	no we wait for a fast secession between Scotland, ireland and north ireland , gibraltar included. Britain will be isolated soon and will lost 90% of companies and commerce with eu zone
1/1	noboby wants to be within the EU anymore. I bet we the French will be the first to follow the Brits when they quit this bloody dictatorial union.
1/1	nobody cares lol
1/1	nobody in their right mind would believe we are about to start deporting people who live here
1/1	none have impacted me directly, its more the impact on my society for example the EU common fisheries policy has severy damaged my countries fishing industry, the free movement of labour has also severly impacted the job and housing markets in my country making it harder to get employment that pays well and making it harder to get a house,
1/1	not forgetting every doom and gloom story that has come out since brexit started hasn't come true I find it very difficult to believe what they're going to come out with
1/1	not from england and i support england and agree for that move ..david comeron you are possy  you should stand for your country mf and respect the england desire
0/0	not often we get to watch a country like Britain burn itself to the ground.
1/1	now I would vote in favour of Brexit. The reason is the way the EU has been so difficult in offering a beneficial deal to the UK on trade. I am a big free trader and I believe that there should be no restrictions on trade.
1/0/1/1/1	now the eu doesnt have to listen to the stupid British complaining all the time
0/0	oh christ  #r4today, you manage to interview the only person in public life in  Ireland who thinks #brexit is a good idea You are a disgrace.

1/1	please, please lets have another referendum so all the idiots who want a vote on the final 'deal' will at last find the majority of voters still want brexit.
0/0	potential benefits of brexit: none.
1/1	probably more the latter since alot of the laws are pretty minor (although for the economy needless bureaucracy can be really bad for minor buisnesses making it easy for large corps to crush small competition) but having a superior power makes my vote mean less and their are laws as i said my country cant change directly.  not only that the EU is getting more and more centralised to the point where it wants to become a federal state much like the US or Germany i dont want to be in a nation with Europe we have conflicting goals values and principles and i am concerned because of the structure of the EU (the people who initiate votes for laws or the removal of laws arent elected by the people) the whole of europe could fall under a tyranical state.

0/0	rexit makes me so sad
1/1	screw the E.U. soon they will collapse and all that will be irellivant.
0/0	self inflicted self harm DEAL with it leavers

0/0	sn't it mad that we are literally living in a geographical and historical case study
1/0	so britain can get a vote leave the EU, which evidently has turned out for the worst, but America cant even get a vote to ban guns
0/0	so the benefits of Brexit were nothing but lies and racism and in reality it brought nothing but trouble, which everyone remotely competent was able to clearly see coming. we really should've taken this as a warning sign.
0/1	so you'd buy some gas, internet and car insurance on a permanent fixed contract for the rest of your life ?
1/1	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !
1/1	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !! üò®
0/0	some leavers don't like facts i see. Let's be honest, the only plausible reason to leave the EU is because of the undemocratic way the EU operate, but at the same time has immigration been that much of an issue on the whole? Are foreigners to blame for all our problems? and did anyone on the leave side expect it to be a case of 'just leave, it'll be easy'. No. At the cost of our economy crashing, many innocents jobs in jeopardy, and the poorest and most vulnerable people being badly affected. All that doesn't matter i guess, so long as we leave the EU?
0/0	sorry we haven't left yet. I think we should trust all the economic experts who know more about this than any of us. we will be worse off as a result of leaving. there is no evidence to suggest we will be better off. we shouldn't have left

1/1	surprising how Remainers call a non binding amendment a democratic vote and go on about referendum of 2016 being advisory .these people flip flop more than corybn
1/1	t's a judgement call. Are you a lion who leads or a sheep who follows?
0/0	t's sad what xenophobia did to the UK! The British people decided to lose their economy and social welfare to get rid of foreigners (This is what Brexit actually rmeans). This is Fascism!

1/1	the EU as it is today is a terrible union and it needs to go away or becomes something better and it's not going to do that by choice as it's clearly proven time and time again.
1/1	the EU has become a straight up crime against the people of europe.
1/1	the EU has demonstrated that leaving the EU not possible without being bullied and harrassed into greeing to still be tied to the EU. Effectively staying in the EU.
1/0	the EU is a supranational, democratically subversive, federalist institution, that cares nought for the least advantaged, and is leading Europe by the nose to a high-tech, feudalist future, as a first step to a globalist NWO.
1/1	the EU is also the slowest growing economy well other than Antarctica...

1/1	the EU is in serious trouble right NOW and through its own incompetence, has boxed itself in, Brexit is a total irrelevance.
1/1	the EU is killing Europe
0/0	the EU is more democratic than the UK
1/1	the EU is un elected oligarch ruling over Europe, no wonder Britain wants to leave
1/1	the EU stinks
0/0	the EU suffocates sovereignty and freedom? How backwards. I've lived in 3 different EU countries in my life, I feel free and I do not feel attached to one state only. There are European elections btw for those who say they do not have a right to vote. It's not right to criticise sitting on your arse at home when no one does his homework to find out about the rights given to him. Anyway, it is done. Do not come back crying.
0/-1	the French politicians are idiots to tell Britain that Calais jungle would move to Britain in case of Brexit, there's no forceful law that says that even in the case of no Brexit Calais jungle should remain in France
1/1	the Irish Border "issue" is just an invention to stop Brexit
1/1/1	the UK has its democracy back.
1/1	the UK leadership is betraying its people by delaying Brexit and ignoring the people's vote to leave.
0/1	the UK needs the EU far more than the other way around,
0/0	the UK will go back where they came from before they joined the EU: The bottom of the pile financially. Good luck to them.
0/0	the UK's economy will collapse and the UK will fall apart
1/1	the best thing will be to get out of EU. the filthy propaganda of better in are all lies. u.k will be finished if it stays in. E.U is colapsing anyway
0/0	the brexit will destroy the uk
0/-1	the country which colonised the entire world is fearing immigration what an irony
1/1	the day after Brexit... will be the start of EU dissolution as other smart countries vote to leave one by one
0/0	the economical and political consequences for Britain will be significant ... The pro - Brexit are blind by their dogmatic and dangerous nationalism ...
1/1	the eu need us more than we need them
1/1	the germans have finally taken all other countries in europe under their control without a shot being fired.
0	the goal should be one global union, brexit is a huge step back ... everybody involved will suffer...
1/1	the goverment should hurry up and get on with brexit go we can get on mking great briton again!.
1	the idea is that Britain will be more free and accountable
0/0	the main mood of people is to stay in the EU. Their blinkered view will destroy the union as Scotland and Wales will leave, to remain. Those living in the past will get a massive shock, there will be anger,
1/1	the more foreigners that leave the better.
0/0	the only good thing about Brexit is that it will herald the end of the Tory party
0/1	the only ones who want to stay are greedy selfish business people and liberals who jobs and work have not been effected yet by mass imigration
1/1	the only way to fix the mess is to accept the brexit
1/1	the people have spoken ,Govt for the people by the people and not un elected Foreign crooks in EU,  Freedom n Democracy come at a price , and one i am prepared to pay ,at least it will be my decision and not some faceless un elected Beaurocrats in EU,NOW WE CAN CONTROL OUR BORDERS, kICK OUT FOREIGN CRIMINALS without the Court of Human Rights interfering,etc, get our schools n education n Health system back and stop all foreign spongers EU or not as we the UK will decide who we want and not Brussels
1/1	the people voted out, they never voted in.
0/0	the pissing contest of migrants and non-migrants is false. The owners of business drive this trend. They don't care where you were born, they want to fuck the workers over for profit.    we don't want these kind of people in business. Once they're squeezed out, it's remarkable how working for a decent boss/company changes your outlook on the world.
1/1	the plan is: 1) Pretend a decent deal is impossible, (it isn't.) 2) Pretend that no deal is worse than a plague of boils. (it isn't.) and therefore, 3) Insist we have to stay in. (We don't want to.) The EU must think we're stupid if they expect us to swallow that nonsense. WTO in March is now the best deal. Then perhaps talk after the money tap is turned off.
0/-1	the pound plummeted immediately after the result
1/0	the pound was lower against the Euro back in Dec 2008 than it is at present
0/0	the problem is most of the people who are supporting the brexit don't know what they are doing
1/1	the reason I voted to leave what I call the EU(SSR) is because I see it surging towards a Globalist Super State, very nice for the wealthy political elite but not for the 'ordinary' citizen who's main function would be to pay for it
1/1	the remain campaign literally has only even given hypothetical scare stories, they never bring up any positive benefits of being in it, I can't even list a good reason to stay
0/0	the simple truth is britain will lose wealth without the EU
1/1	the sooner we get rid of free movement off people and an laws imposed by the EU the better we will be
0/0	the sun backs the leave campaign and you should know to always do the opposite of what the sun tells you #voteremain
1/1	the supranational centralisation of power undermines British democracy
0/0	the trouble with democracy is that everyone gets to vote...
1/1	the uk leave success will set other european countrys free..it will help spread democracy to other countrys.
0/0	the uk outside of europe will have no future place in big table politics ,there will be no inward investment and we will still trade with europe but will now be subject to Tariffs and Quotas .The only people who want us out are the Racists in our country who despise anyone who is not British sorry should have read ENGLISH . As for no room left did you know that more land in the UK is allocated to Golf courses than for House Building.
0/0	the voters were deceived by lies into voting for Brexit, but the government doesn't see why they should have a revote with the lies exposed and the thousands signing the petition for a second vote, because apparently the people can't change their minds now the truth has been brought to light
0/0	the worst-case scenario‚Äîno future trade deal with the EU, no transition period at the end of March 2019, and a loss of trade agreements with non-EU countries‚ÄîGDP would fall by more than 10%.
1/0	their are a large number of laws that i have to follow that where not implemented by my parliament or by one of my elected represetatives laws me and my countrymen cant change because it requires the votes of people from other nations.
1/1	their are a large number of laws that i have to follow that where not implemented by my parliament or by one of my elected represetatives laws me and my countrymen cant change because it requires the votes of people from other nations.  i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.
1/1	then it‚Äôs out right war and I mean war on the streets we brexetiers will never except a vote to remain in the Mafia EU
0/0	there are so may things wrong with brexit that i would even know where to begin...
0/0	there is no version of Brexit that is better than what we currently have. None. People will be poorer with all versions of Brexit.
1/1	there's a lot of spin out there, it's difficult to sift through. I'm not worried about leaving... The EU is falling apart and we're on the edge of a world reccession. Better to get a head start.
0/0	these british people always have their own heads, always so egoistic and thinking they are superior to anyone else
0/0	these leavers are ignorant pigs.
1/1	they are all limited by EU tariffs etc. So not good enough. Plus they steal our money via our subsidy.
1/1	they don't live in an area where, locals have been pushed out of the work place
1/1	they still don't get it. We haven't lost Europe We REJECTED EU. We love Europe. Actually, the title should be "how EU lost Europe". many countries are unrecognisable due to uncontrolled high immigration.
1/1	they turned leave or dont leave into deal or no deal. we voted leave. THEY want a deal.
0/0	they'll regret it very soon. sadly

0/0	this is fucking depressing two years later
0/0	this is one of the worse days for the uk! This is not independence day
0/0	this is so said... and I truly hope that our kids can fix it again what we have missed to address properly. We should quickly allow to define a mode of working together with focus on the youth and future generations. The challenge is not a border or the EU, the challenge is how do we all survive facing radical environmental changes. I love the spirit of the EU and I love the UK.
1/1	this is the best possible thing to happen. no more of the big banks and controlling politicians. this video is biases and don't believe whay you hear. down with big government
1/1	this traitorous cow is not doing what the people voted for it was remain or out never mentioned was to strike a deal she obviously isn't doing what the people voted for democracy in this country is dead

0/0	ust forget about brexit. Most of us want to stay but the stupid UK government is blindly determined to drive us all off a cliff to honour an old decision by an ill-informed public that should never have been theirs to make in the first place.
0/0	very sad  .. UK can not stand on his own.....apparently , British,  you need France-Germany to survive...where is the famous British pride ....where are the famous WW2 British soldiers ...very sad.....you can not manage alone..for God sake

0/0	voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
1/1	wages are going to go up. House prices are going to come down. Communities are going to be less impacted with incoming migrants. Legislation will be made at a more accountable level and your vote will mean more, there will be a wider array of choices at the ballot box.
1/0	wake up and smell the #democracy - the people have spoken & you work for us - so do your job & uphold the will of the people
1/1	walk away no deal dont give eu any more money
0/1	was absolutely gutted by the result. I still feel we should have remained in. However, it's vital that the British people unite to make a success of this. There are definitely opportunities and if 48% of the population stand around whinging we won't have a chance of making this work for us.

No shengen area, no trade rules with the EU. and the UK returns to being part of the global economy, with fair trade deals with the entire rest of the world, Free to decide it's own regulations, which may or may not be in line with the EU, but it will be up to the UK, Not the EU, what any policies are for the UK

0/1	you can sense it..the MPs want to cancel Brexit..the best way is to have a second referendum about it.
0/0	you do realise the people who want to leave want to scrap the NHS. also food will be more expensive as we get a lot from the EU. wants wrong with immigrants?
